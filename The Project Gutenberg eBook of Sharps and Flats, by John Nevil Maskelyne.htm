<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p class="p2">In presenting the following pages to the public, I have
had in view a very serious purpose. Here and there
may be found a few words spoken in jest; but throughout
my aim has been particularly earnest.</p>

<p>This book, in fact, tends to point a moral, and present
a problem. The moral is obvious, the problem is
ethical; which is, perhaps, only another way of saying
something different.</p>

<p>In the realm of Ethics, the two men who exert, probably,
the greatest influence upon the mass of humanity
are the philosopher and the politician. Yet, strange to
say, there would appear to be little that can be considered
as common knowledge in either politics or philosophy.
Every politician and every philosopher holds opinions
which are diametrically opposed to those of some other
politician or philosopher; and there never yet existed,
apparently, either politician or philosopher who would
admit even that his opponents were acquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
fact of two and two making four. So much, then, for
dogmatism.</p>

<p>In the natural order of events, however, there must
be things which even a politician can understand. Not
many things, perhaps; but still some things. In like
manner, there must be things which even a philosopher
can <i>not</i> understand—and a great many things.</p>

<p>As an illustration, let us take the case of 'sharping.'
Politician and philosopher alike are interested in the
origin of crime, its development, and the means of its prevention.
Now, even a politician can understand that a
man, having in view the acquisition of unearned increment,
may take to cheating as being a ready means of
possessing himself of the property of others, with but
little effort upon his own part. At the same time, I will
venture to say that not even a philosopher can render
any adequate reason for the fact that some men will devote
an amount of energy, labour, perseverance and ingenuity
to the gaining of a precarious living in the paths
of chicanery, one-half of which, if directed into legitimate
channels, would serve to place them in a position
commanding both affluence and respect.</p>

<p>To my mind, the only hypothesis which in any way
covers the facts of the case is that some men are <i>born</i> to
crime. It is their destiny, and they are bound to fulfil it.</p>

<p>Whether this hypothesis represents the solution of the
problem or not is a bone of contention over which I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
content to allow others to quarrel, without joining in the
fray. I am only concerned with the facts as we know
them—the plain and unmistakable facts that cheating,
upon a gigantic scale, <i>does</i> exist; that the resources available
for its advancement become every day more numerous,
whilst the means of its prevention become more
and more inadequate.</p>

<p>A goodly portion of my life has been spent in battling
with superstition, credulity and chicanery in every form.
It has been a labour of love with me. At times I have,
so to speak, cried from the house-top truths so obvious
that there hardly seemed any necessity for calling attention
to them, and yet have found some who could not
believe them. Again and again, Time, the prover of all
things, has without exception borne out my statements to
the very letter; yet even now there are some who will prefer
to rely upon the word of a charlatan—an impostor—rather
than accept a plain statement of palpable facts at
my hands. It is curious, but nevertheless it is true.
It is magnificent, but it is not common sense. Fortunately,
however, there are not many such, though some
there are.</p>

<p>Experience has demonstrated that the ignorance of
the public with regard to the capabilities of trickery is
the principal factor in all problems connected with
every kind of deception. If the public only knew a little
more in this respect, the thousand-and-one quackeries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
which flourish in our midst could not exist. My self-imposed
task, then, has ever been to endeavour to
educate the public, just a little, and to enlighten those
who really seek for truth amid the noxious and perennial
weeds of humbug and pretence. In this, I am happy to
say, I have to some extent succeeded; but there is still
much to be done.</p>

<p>This book, then, is but another stone, as it were, in
an edifice raised for the purpose of showing to the world
the real nature of those things which are not really what
they appear to be, and practices with the very existence
of which the average man is unacquainted.</p>

<p>Although the immediate practical outcome of this
book may be <i>nil</i>, I shall not be depressed upon that
account. If it only has the effect of opening the eyes of
the authorities to some extent, and of hinting a caution to
gamblers generally, I shall be content; and, commending
it to the public with this reflection, and with the
hope that this much, at least, may be accomplished,
I leave it to its fate.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>INTRODUCTORY</i></span></h2>

<p>That 'it requires all kinds of men to make a world,'
is an aphorism which may or may not be gainsaid,
according to the aspect in which it is regarded. For
whilst, on the one hand, we are painfully cognisant of the
fact that this world, as we find it, is composed of 'all
sorts and conditions of men,' and among them not a few
sorts with which we could very readily dispense, still, on
the other hand, the idea of a world with some of the existing
components omitted is by no means inconceivable.
Do we not, in fact, every day of our lives, meet with
schemes, philanthropic and otherwise, formulated expressly
for the regeneration of man? Yes, we know them
of old; those schemes which, according to their gifted
authors, are to elevate mankind to one universal level of
goodness and purity. Sad to say, however, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
these well-meant efforts, continued from time immemorial,
mankind would appear to be in about the same
unregenerate condition as ever. The 'kinds of men'
seem to multiply rather than to diminish, and the long-deferred
millennium looms as far off in the dim and distant
future as at any period of the world's history.</p>

<p>Accepting, then, this many-sided world of ours as an
established fact, impossible of modification, it is obvious
that, to quote another time-honoured proverb, and say
that 'one half the world does not know how the other
half lives,' is to convey but a very feeble and inadequate
idea of the real facts of the case. All things considered,
it may be safely said that the majority know far too little
of the means of subsistence employed by their fellows,
and, in consequence, often suffer for that lack of knowledge.
The fact is, too many of us possess the gentleness
of the dove (more or less) without the qualifying and
ever-necessary wisdom of the serpent.</p>

<p>Among the bye-paths of existence, among the various
underhand methods of obtaining a living—sweet little
conceptions evolved, presumably, from the primordial
basis of original sin—probably there is none so little
understood by the community at large as the art and
practice of 'sharping.' At the same time, it is not too
much to say that there is no subject more worthy of
serious consideration, when regarded in the relation it
holds to the moral well-being of mankind in general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
It is, of course, common knowledge that there are
in existence individuals who live by cheating at games
of chance and skill, but few persons have any idea of
the extent to which the practice obtains, or of the number
of the professors of this particular branch of swindling.</p>

<p>Possibly, of the work-a-day inhabitants of this planet,
nine persons out of ten of the majority who are 'indifferent
honest,' will be inclined to a belief that sharping, at the
worst, can form but a very insignificant factor in the
social problems of modern times. A glance at the
contents of this book, however, will serve to remove that
very erroneous impression. The author is not raising a
'bogey' for the purpose of pretending to demolish it.
The spectre is a very substantial one indeed, and the
task of 'laying' it is far beyond the power of any one man
to accomplish.</p>

<p>The system, in fact, is a gigantic one, and its professors
are legion. It is as thriving an industry (save the
mark) as any in the world. It is as perfectly organised
in every department as any legitimate business. Its
markets are regulated by the same inexorable laws of
supply and demand, competition and coöperation, which
govern the development of every branch of commerce.
It has its manufacturers, its wholesale houses, its canvassers
and retail dealers, all in regular form. Its price-lists,
descriptive pamphlets, circulars and advertisements are
issued as methodically as those of <i>bonâ fide</i> merchants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
traders. Its ramifications extend to every quarter of the
globe.</p>

<p>This book will show that not only is a thriving trade
in cheating utensils carried on openly and unblushingly,
but also that there must be an enormous number of
swindlers at large, who live by means of unfair practices
in connection with all forms of gambling; sharps who
are still undetected, and, notwithstanding the vigilance
of the authorities, are still pursuing their calling under the
very eyes of Justice.</p>

<p>Startling as these statements may appear to the uninitiated,
of their absolute truth there cannot exist the
slightest doubt in the mind of anyone who will take the
trouble to glance through these pages. This book, in
fact, may be regarded as 'The Sharp's Vade Mecum, or
a Theoretical and Practical Treatise on the Art and
Practice of Cheating.' No pains have been spared to
make it as complete as possible, and, if advantage be
taken of the instructions it contains, and any person of
dishonest tendencies utilises the same for the purpose of
swindling his fellow-men, it will be entirely the fault of
those who have not profited by the information which the
author has given.</p>

<p>That the condition of affairs herein revealed should
be found to exist in the midst of our boasted civilisation
is a fact which is, to say the least, deplorable. Further,
it is a fact which urgently demands that every possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
effort should be made towards its mitigation by those who
may find themselves in a position to obtain information
respecting these nefarious practices, and to throw light
into the recesses of this obscure phase of human nature.</p>

<p>By far the major portion of the details given in these
pages have never before been made public. Even
among exponents of legitimate legerdemain, there are
very few who have any cognisance of them whatever. It
is obvious that a professional illusionist having a reputation
for 'squareness' is at a decided disadvantage in
seeking for information of this kind. The author, for
instance, being so well known to the swindling fraternity
as an exposer of frauds, could not possibly have acquired
without assistance the countless minutiæ which have come
into his possession. The very suspicion that he was engaged
in such an investigation would be sufficient to dry
up all sources of information, and to remove all possibility
of arriving at anything of moment. He has therefore
to acknowledge his indebtedness for much that is
valuable to a friend who desires to be nameless. In
the assumed guise of an English 'sharp,' this gentleman
has pursued his investigations to such good purpose that
he has gained a fund of information relative to 'sharps
and sharping,' which may be fairly said to include all
the most important methods employed at the present
day. The information so obtained has been freely
drawn upon in the production of this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
The head-quarters of this abominable system of
wholesale robbery are to be sought for in the land which
has bestowed upon civilisation so many blessings of
a similar character. From the spirit-medium to the
wooden nutmeg, they all hail from that most 'go-ahead,'
and yet most easily hoodwinked country, America.
True, there are so many dunderheads of all nationalities
who can never realise the truth of that simple maxim
which teaches that 'honesty is the best policy,' and
such a very large proportion of these have turned their
steps to America, that it is, perhaps, hardly fair to regard
them as an integral part of the American nation. Still there
they are, and it behoves America to grasp the situation
with a much firmer hand than heretofore, with a view
to the suppression of these pernicious creatures, and of
attaining a reputation more in accord with her honourable
traditions—more worthy of the great names associated
with her history.</p>

<p>There is every reason for believing that at the present
moment England is the happy hunting-ground of the
swindling fraternity, and for this reason. In America
many of the older frauds are tolerably well-known to
those who are addicted to gambling, but over here most
of these things are absolutely unknown. Even the English
sharp himself is in a condition of unsophisticated
innocence compared with his American rival.</p>

<p>It is certain that our ocean steamboats are infested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
with gangs of men, provided with these means of relieving
their fellow-passengers of superfluous cash. And
in all probability, every one of our 'swellest' clubs
possesses at least one member who makes a good living
by the use of methods and contrivances never dreamt of
by his dupes. It is true, the 'Dudley Smooths' of to-day
are no longer cold-blooded duellists who can over-awe
their victims with the dread of sword and pistol,
but they are quite as keen as they ever were, and their
resources are infinitely greater than formerly.</p>

<p>Of course there is not the slightest necessity for anyone,
however foolish, to fall a victim to the wiles of the
sharper in any game either of skill or chance. There is
no reason why the greatest simpleton alive should ever
be cheated of his money. There is one golden rule,
the observance of which must utterly checkmate the
most cunning swindler. It is a rule by which the author
has always been guided, and one which, were it universally
adopted, would banish the cheat and his paraphernalia
from the face of the earth. It is a system which is
easily learned and which requires no skill in execution.
It is simply to abstain from every form of gambling whatever.
Make up your mind that 'you want no man's money,
and that no man shall have yours,'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and you cannot
come to much harm in this direction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>It would seem, however, that there is a kind of fatal
fascination in gambling which some persons appear to be
wholly unable to resist. It is therefore quite as well that
those who <i>will</i> indulge in such an expensive propensity
should do so, at least, with their eyes open. On this
account, if for no other reason, the publication of this
book is fully justified, and any apology for its appearance
would be superfluous.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to deal with the subject
historically. Quite sufficient scope is afforded for a work
of this kind in the undertaking to set forth an account of
such frauds as are practised at the present day. Our
attention therefore will be chiefly directed towards
devices which are of recent invention, together with those
that have survived in practice from former times.</p>

<p>The originals of the various circulars &amp;c., reprints of
which are given in the following pages, are in the author's
possession. The names and addresses of the firms from
which they emanate are, however, for very obvious reasons,
omitted from these reprints, though all else is given
verbatim. The illustrations are all taken from actual
articles, purchased for the avowed purpose of cheating
by their means. The reader will thus be enabled
to gather some idea as to the amount of misplaced
ingenuity which has been brought to bear upon the production
of these <i>fin-de-siècle</i> appliances for robbing the
unwary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
This much, then, having been said by way of introduction,
we may at once proceed to consider systematically
the methods of the modern 'sharp;' and to describe,
for the first time in any language, the various mechanical
and other devices he uses, and the manner in which they
are employed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>COMMON SHARPERS AND THEIR TRICKS</i></span></h2>

<p>In dealing with a subject of so wide a character as
that upon which we are engaged, the difficulty of beginning
at the beginning is greater than may appear to a
casual reader. There are so many points from which it
may be attacked. As to treating of all that is known in
reference to it, or tracing it back to the earliest records,
that, of course, is out of the question in the limited space
at our disposal. Even were one historically inclined, who
can say where the beginning begins. Doubtless, one
would have to search the geological formations at great
depth in order to discover remains of that man who
first conceived the idea of correcting fickle fortune at the
expense of his fellows. If science ever achieves this
discovery, we shall certainly have reasonable grounds for
believing that we have found a very near relative of
Adam.</p>

<p>Although the general public have so little acquaintance
with the higher developments of cheating, still, a great deal
has been written concerning some of the more elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
methods. This being so, the question of what ought to
be left out—at what point we ought to take up the thread
of our discourse—becomes of paramount importance.
Obviously, it is useless to repeat what is well-known.</p>

<p>Many of these primitive methods, however, are still
so frequently practised, that this book would be incomplete
without some reference at least being made to
the more important among them. Therefore, with a view
to clearing the ground for what is to follow, and for the
benefit of the general reader, this chapter will be devoted
to the more familiar systems of 'sharping.'</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no field of operation so prolific in
specimens of the genus 'sharp' as a race-course and its
approaches upon the occasion of a popular race-meeting.
For our present purpose, therefore, we cannot do better
than to imagine, for the moment, that we are on our
way to some such gathering. Arriving at the London
terminus, in good time for our train, we take our seats
in a second-class smoking compartment. Possibly the
only other occupants of the carriage at first are two
or three holiday makers, on pleasure bent. Not really
sporting men, but average citizens, looking forward to the
excitement of the race, and also possibly to the pleasurable
anxiety of a little 'flutter,' at long odds or
otherwise.</p>

<p>It is not long before the other seats are all occupied.
A man of decidedly 'sporting' appearance, with a field-glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
slung over his shoulder, and carrying a thick
travelling rug, strolls leisurely by the door, merely
glancing in as he passes. In a few moments, however,
he returns, and takes a middle seat in the compartment.
Then follow two or three others, averaging in appearance
something between sporting characters and second-rate
commercial travellers. These take whatever seats may
happen to be vacant, and either become absorbed in
their newspapers or enter into conversation with their
neighbours, as the case may be. The experienced
reader will have no need to be told that we are
associating with a gang working the 'three-card trick.'
The man in sporting attire is the 'sharp,' and those who
accidentally (?) dropped in after him are his confederates.</p>

<p>No sooner is the train well on its way, than our friend
of the field-glasses takes down his rug from the rack,
folds it across his knees, and producing a pack of cards,
selects three—generally a king and two others—which he
throws, face upward, upon the rug.</p>

<p>'Now, gentlemen,' he says, 'I think we'll have a little
game, just to pass the time. Anyhow, if it amuses me,
it won't hurt you.' With these or some such words by
way of preface, he takes up the three cards, and throws
them, one at a time, face downward, upon the rug. Then,
with much rapidity, he transposes the positions of the
cards several times, and observes, 'Now, tell me which
is the king, and stake your money.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Having thus attracted attention, he commences again.
At this point, one of the confederates looks calmly up
from his paper, and murmurs something to his neighbour
about 'making one's expenses.' Probably, also, he will
produce a couple of sovereigns.</p>

<p>'Now, gentlemen,' continues the sharp, 'there are two
cards for you,'—taking them up—'and one card for me.
The king is mine,'—taking it up—'the ace and the
seven are yours.' Then, with everyone in the carriage
following his movements, he again throws the cards
down and manipulates them as before. 'Now, tell me
which is my card,' he says. Nobody responds, however;
and the sharp picks up the king, which proves to be in
the position where one would expect to find it. Indeed,
the on-looker who could not follow the king through its
various evolutions would be dull of perception.</p>

<p>Again and again the performance is repeated, and
every time the on-lookers can follow the movements of
the king with the utmost ease. At length, in response
to an appeal from the operator 'not to be backward,
gentlemen,' the confederate who produced the sovereigns
a little while ago suddenly dashes one down on the
card which all believe to be the king. The card is turned
up, and proves to be the right one, consequently he
receives the amount of his stake.</p>

<p>At the next turn another confederate stakes a
sovereign, and wins. The same thing follows with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
third. Then, perhaps, the first stakes two sovereigns,
and again wins. Not only so, but taking advantage of
the obviously unsuspicious nature of the operator, he
picks up the card himself, and in so doing accidentally
bends one corner up slightly.</p>

<p>Now everyone has heard of the three-card trick, though
not one in a thousand knows how it is worked. Consequently,
the uninitiated among our associates, finding
that they are able to trace the king unerringly, begin to
think that, either this operator is a duffer, or that they are
particularly sharp fellows. Besides, there is the king,
going about with a turned-up corner, and losing money
for the performer at every turn. Small wonder, then,
that their cupidity is aroused, and at length one of
them stakes a sovereign on the card with the turned-up
corner. And he wins? Oh, dear no! By some, unaccountable
mischance, the king has become straightened
in the course of manipulation, and a corner of one of the
other cards has been turned up. Singular, is it not?
Of course the loser cannot complain, or he would have
to admit that he had been trying to take an unfair
advantage of his opponent. Therefore he resolves to
trust entirely to his judgment in the future.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, apparently, the operator
notices the defective corner and straightens it. Again
the cards are thrown down, and the last player, thinking
to retrieve his loss, stakes another sovereign. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
kept his eyes intently upon the king, as it passed from
side to side and back to the centre. He feels confident
of success this time; but there is a mistake somewhere,
for again he loses.</p>

<p>And so the game goes on, with unvarying result.
Whenever one of the first two or three players—the confederates—stakes
his money, he always wins. Everyone
else always loses. Eventually, the game is discontinued;
either owing to the fact that no more stakes are to be
had, or that we are approaching our destination.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the train, if we are curious, we may
easily discover which of our late companions are the
confederates. They leave the carriage to all appearance
perfect strangers to one another; but follow one of them
at a distance, and it will be found that they are fairly well-acquainted
when not professionally employed.</p>

<p>This trick is an extremely simple one; and is accomplished
as follows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_033.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="215"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Three-card Trick.</div>
</div>

<p>When the cards are taken up, preparatory to
manipulation, they are held as indicated in fig. 1. First,
the two indifferent cards are taken, one in each hand,
and next, the king in the right hand. Card No. 2 in
the illustration, therefore, is the king. In throwing
down the cards at the outset No. 1 card is placed in
position 1; No. 2 card in position 2; and No. 3 in
position 3. Thus, the king occupies a position between
the two other cards. So far, all is plain sailing, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
is by no means difficult to trace the movements of the
card we are following up, however deftly it may be
manipulated. There is a saying that 'the quickness of
the hand deceives the eye.' That is nonsense. No
hand, however expert, can produce a movement so quick
that the eye cannot detect it. What really deceives the
eye in sleight of hand is that some of the movements
are not exactly what they appear to be, their real nature
is skilfully disguised. Of this the three card trick is a
good example. When the sharp observes his pigeon
getting ready to be plucked, he changes his tactics
slightly from the straightforward course he has hitherto
pursued. The cards appear to be thrown down in the
same manner as before, but it is not so. In this case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
No. 1 card is thrown down in No. 1 position, as at the
outset; but, instead of throwing down No. 2—the king—in
No. 2 position, it is card No. 3 which is allowed to
fall, and the king goes finally into position 3. Thus
the uninitiated, instead of following up the king, as they
fondly believe, are really on the trail of card No. 3.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that the turned-up
corner can present no difficulty to a sharp who has
devoted a little practice to its rectification. The act of
throwing down the cards is quite sufficient to cover all
the movement which is necessary.</p>

<p>Instead of ear-marking the card by turning up a
corner, the confederate will sometimes tear off a very
minute scrap from his newspaper, and, wetting it, will
attach it to a corner of the card as he turns it up.
When this is done, the operator of course contrives to
slip the moistened fragment from one card to another.</p>

<p>Leaving our three-card acquaintances to their own
devices—though, perhaps, our duty would be to give
them into the hands of the police—we will proceed to
the race-course.</p>

<p>Space will not permit us here to consider the numerous
evil devices for acquiring the root of all evil indulged
in by race-course sharps. In fact, these scarcely form
part of our subject. Some of them, such as 'telling
the tale,' and so on, are more or less ingenious; but
at best they are merely vulgar swindles which involve no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
skill beyond the exercise of that tact and plausibility
which are common to sharps and swindlers of every
kind.</p>

<p>Pursuing our investigations, then, let us suppose that
we now approach one of the spots where winners and losers,
sharps and flats, meet on the common ground of applying
meat and drink to the refreshment of body and soul.
Here, if we are favoured, we may chance to meet with a
little entertainment—intellectual and instructive—provided
by the spectacle of three persons who are engaged
in the scientific recreation of spinning coins upon some
convenient corner of table or buffet. Needless to say,
they are two 'sharps' and a 'flat,' and their little game is
'odd man.'</p>

<p>The game is simple, but financially there is a good
deal in it. It is played in this way. Three coins being
spun on edge upon a table, it is obvious that either all
three will fall with the same side up—in which case the
spin must be repeated—or, two will fall one way and one
the other. The owner of the latter coin is the 'odd man.'
There are two systems of playing. Either the odd man is
out—that is to say, he stands aside, whilst the other two
spin for 'head' or 'woman'—or the odd man pays. In
either case, the loser pays the other two. If fairly played,
of course the chances are equal for all three players.
But, alas! even this apparently innocent game is capable
of sophistication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The method of cheating will be seen at a glance on
referring to fig. 2.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 178px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_036.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="155"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>—Bevelled Coins.</div>
</div>

<p>A coin which has been slightly bevelled to one side
will bear a superficial examination without creating suspicion
as to its genuineness. If it has a milled edge, it
must necessarily be re-milled. Such a coin, when spun
on edge, will always tend to fall in one direction. The
bevelling, as shown in the figure, is exaggerated, for
distinctness' sake; in practice, the angle is very slight.</p>

<p>Two 'sportsmen,'
each provided with
coins of this description,
meet with a 'mug'
and propose spinning
for liquid refreshment.
If they are pretty sure
of their man they may
possibly allow him to
win. Afterwards, however,
they lead him on to spin for higher stakes, and
then he invariably loses.</p>

<p>If the game is 'odd man pays,' they spin with coins
which will fall alike; simultaneously changing their coins
from time to time, so that they do not always bring them
same side up. This being so, all three coins must either
fall alike, or else the dupe will be the odd man. Then
he pays each of his companions the amount of the stakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Thus, the chances are dead against the dupe, for his
opponents cannot possibly lose.</p>

<p>When the game is 'odd man out,' the winnings are
not made so rapidly; but at the same time they are
quite as certain, and the proceedings are not so liable to
create suspicion. In this case, the sharps spin with coins
which will fall in different directions, and consequently
the dupe is never the odd man. His coin is bound to
fall the same way as one of the others; so he has to spin
again with one or other of the 'rooks.' If the second spin
is 'head wins,' the sharp will use a coin which falls 'head.'
Here, again, the coins must either fall alike, and the spin
be repeated, or the dupe must lose.</p>

<p>To disarm suspicion, however, the second spin may
occasionally be a fair one; his opponent using a 'square'
coin. Even then, the chances are two to one against him.
Supposing the stakes are a sovereign, the loser has to pay
the two winners a sovereign each; and therefore if the
dupe loses he has to pay two sovereigns, whilst, if he wins,
he receives only one. So much, then, for 'odd man.'</p>

<p>If we search the purlieus of the race-course, we are
sure to find the 'purse trick' well in evidence. A
good many people seem to get a living at it, yet there is
not much mystery connected with it. Its accomplishment
rests purely on sleight of hand. We are all familiar with
the purse purporting to contain a half-crown and a shilling
which the salesman offers to dispose of for the modest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
amount of sixpence or so. It is extraordinary, however,
how few know wherein the trick lies. For the benefit of
those who are unacquainted with it, the following short
description is given.</p>

<p>The man throws a half-crown and a shilling into a
two-penny purse, and the price demanded for the whole
may vary from sixpence to eighteenpence, according to
circumstances. Sometimes the purse, when purchased,
is found to contain the actual amount ostensibly put into
it. 'Springes to catch woodcocks!' The purchaser is
a confederate. In the event of a stranger buying it, the
contents will prove to be a penny and a halfpenny. The
operator really throws the half-crown and shilling into the
purse several times; turning them out again into his
hand, to show the genuineness of the transaction. Or, he
may spin them in the air, and catch them in the purse
by way of variety. But when the time for selling arrives,
although he does not appear to have changed his tactics
in the least, the transmutation of metals becomes an
accomplished fact, silver is converted to bronze.</p>

<p>The man has a money-bag slung in front of him, into
which he is continually dipping his hand, for the purpose
of taking out or returning the coins. This bag seems to
contain only silver, but there is a vein of baser metal
underlying the nobler. Therefore, in taking out a half-crown,
nothing is easier than for the man to palm a
penny at the same time. This being done, it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
penny which goes into the purse, and the half-crown is
transferred, for the moment, to his palm; but only for
the moment. It is dropped, immediately, into the bag;
so that, by the time that his hand has fallen to his side,
it is empty. That is one dodge. Another is to take
the half-crown and penny together in the fingers, the
penny underlying the half-crown, concealed from view.
Then the penny is dropped and the half-crown palmed
as before. Again, the half-crown and shilling being really
in the purse, the man will take them out with his fingers,
apparently for the purpose of showing them to the
multitude, at the same time introducing into the purse
three halfpence which he has held concealed. Then he
appears to throw the silver coins quickly into the purse,
but in reality he palms them, the sound made by the
coins in falling being counterfeited by chinking the
coppers which the purse already contains. A variation
upon this trick is sometimes performed with a piece of
paper in which is screwed up some article of cheap
jewellery, and into which the coins are supposed to be
thrown, as in the purse trick. These men adopt various
methods of explaining their reasons for selling so much
money at so cheap a rate, one of the most common
being that someone has laid a wager that the public are
too sceptical to buy money offered in that manner.
Well, such a wager would be a tolerably safe one; for,
as a rule, the public are only sceptical concerning those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
things which are genuine. It is probably because the
purse-trick is not genuine that the tricksters find purchasers.
It is always the swindle which takes best with
the public. Certainly, anyone who is taken in over this
trick deserves to be.</p>

<p>On our way home in the train we may, perhaps,
encounter a party playing 'Nap.' It may be a friendly
game, fairly played—or it may not. If it is not, we shall
undoubtedly find that one of the players loses heavily.
It is only penny Nap, he is told. Yes, but one can lose
a good deal, in a small way, even at penny Nap. Especially
if the other players know the best and quickest way
of winning.</p>

<p>The most ordinary way of cheating at this game consists
of 'putting up' hands for the dupe and one of the
other players. The methods of accomplishing this
manœuvre will be fully detailed in the chapter on
'Manipulation.' For the present, it is sufficient to say
that the cards are so manipulated that the dupe has
always a good hand. So far, this looks as though matters
should prove very favourable to the dupe; therefore, he
frequently goes 'Nap.' It always happens, however,
that one of the other players holds a hand which is
slightly better. The dupe may even hold the ace, king,
queen, and knave of one suit, and the ace of another.
By every law of the game he is bound to go 'Nap,' and
win. So he makes his long suit trumps, feeling that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
has a 'certainty.' But when the cards are played, it
turns out that one of his opponents holds five small
trumps against his four big ones, and he loses on the
last round.</p>

<p>An incident of this kind is reported, where the dupe,
in a two-handed game, being rendered suspicious by the
eagerness of those about him to wager that he would not
make his Nap, instead of leading out his long suit, made
his odd ace the trump, and thereby won. In a game of
more than two players, this could be prevented by one
of the others holding two cards of the same suit as the
ace. Moral—Don't gamble with strangers. It is never
safe; particularly in a railway train.</p>

<p>The foregoing being sufficient to give the reader a
general idea of the common sharp and his methods, no
more need be said with regard to this elementary branch
of our subject. It will be sufficient to point out that
the sharp usually devotes his entire energies to perfecting
himself in some particular game. Having found his victim,
he feigns indifferent play, and encourages the dupe
to 'take him on.' No matter how skilful he may be, he
never allows any evidence of the fact to escape him.
One does not find a card-sharper, for instance, entertaining
his chance acquaintances with card-tricks—at
least, not to their knowledge. To use the language
which he would probably adopt, such a proceeding
would be 'giving himself away with a pound of tea.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The sharp's motto is, 'Art is to conceal art;' and his success
in life depends very greatly upon the strict observation
of this maxim.</p>

<p>Skill, however, is not the only qualification necessary
to the successful sharp. He must have unbounded self-confidence
if his wiles are to be of any avail. In addition,
he must also possess tact and address, for upon
these two qualities will depend the grade of society into
which he will be enabled to carry his operations. Given
a liberal endowment of these two attributes, there is no
circle, however high or however select, into which the
sharp will not ultimately penetrate. The public have
occasionally an opportunity of peeping behind the
scenes, but the cases of cheating which come to light
bear a very small proportion to those which are condoned
or hushed up, and the number of these again
is nothing when compared with the infinity of cases
which are never discovered.</p>

<p>All the comparatively insignificant matters dealt with
so far are of course common knowledge to many. As
before mentioned, however, the general public know very
little of them, otherwise the numbers who gain a living
by such means could not exist. It is for this reason
only that they have been even referred to here. Other
and far more ingenious trickeries call for our attention,
and to these we will now pass on.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>MARKED CARDS AND THE MANNER OF THEIR
EMPLOYMENT</i></span></h2>

<p>Probably it was at no very recent date in the history
of card-playing that some genius first recognised the advantage
which would accrue to a player who could devise
some means of placing a distinctive mark on the back
of each card, imperceptible to all but himself, to indicate
its suit and value. Every card-player must at some time
or other have exclaimed mentally, 'Oh, if I only knew
what cards my opponents hold!' There one has, then,
the origin of marked cards. The sharp, above all others,
desires to know his opponent's cards. It is almost a
necessity of his existence; and in his case it is certainly
true that 'necessity is the mother of invention,' and
'knows no law.' Whatever the sharp may find necessary
he is sure to acquire, and will not be scrupulous as to
the manner of its acquisition.</p>

<p>The systems of card-marking are as numerous as they
are ingenious. They vary from a mark which covers the
greater portion of the back of the card to a mark which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is invisible. This latter may not appear to be of much
utility, but it must be borne in mind the sharp is not
restricted to the use of the sense of sight only. Sometimes,
indeed, it is necessary for him to know the cards
without looking at them, and then a visible mark would
be of no possible use to him.</p>

<p>So numerous, indeed, are the systems of marking—almost
every card-sharper, worthy of the name, having a
system peculiar to himself—that it is impossible to give a
tenth part of them. To attempt to do so would be to
weary the reader, and, further, it is unnecessary. All
these various systems are capable of general classification,
and a few leading instances will suffice to give the key to
the whole. For brevity and convenience, then, we will
consider the subject under the following heads:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>§ A—<i>General principles of marking.</i>—Whatever
method of marking may be adopted in the preparation
of 'faked' cards or 'readers,' however recondite that
method may be, it is referable to one or other of two
general principles. That is to say, either the cards have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
each a distinctive mark placed in some convenient position,
or the mark is similar in every case, the indication
being given by the position which it occupies. Some
systems are based upon a combination of the two principles;
but all are developments of either one or the
other. When the mark, whatever it may be, is placed
at one end of the card, it is of course necessary to
mark both ends.</p>

<p>The chief desideratum in marking, of course, is to
produce work which is easily decipherable to the
trained eye of the expert, but which nevertheless is invisible
to others. How well this has been accomplished
will be seen from the examples which follow. Many of
the specimens given herein have been submitted to
experts who have been allowed to retain them as long
as they pleased, and have been returned with the statement
that to all appearance the cards have not been
tampered with, no mark being discoverable. This being
the case, what chance has a player of detecting the
falsification, in the very cursory examination which is
possible during play? As the reader will perceive,
there is no difficulty in marking cards in such a manner
as will arouse no suspicion. Anyone could invent a
system which no one but himself could decipher, and
which would defy detection. The only difficulty is to
read the marks with speed and accuracy. In many
games it is only necessary to know which are high cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and which are low; then the matter is considerably
simplified. In some games it is not even necessary to
know the suit of the cards, and thus the case is
simplified still further. It is rarely, indeed, that the
sharp requires to know all the cards. Generally speaking,
if all the picture-cards and the aces are marked, that will
give him all the advantage he needs. The rest may be
left to chance and good play. In fact, the sharp uses
trickery as little as possible; he never overdoes the
thing. Whilst he is winning, he is, as a rule, content to
win fairly, for the most part. His subtle methods are
reserved—or should be, if he knows his business—for
occasions when chance is against him. The fewer are
the cards which are marked, the less the chance of
detection, and the less the marks are resorted to the
better. Obviously, the man who has it in his power to
stock his hand with high cards at will, need never be in
a hurry to win. The game is in his hands. The sharp
who uses marked cards will always contrive to 'work in'
those he has prepared when possible, but failing this,
he is generally in a position to mark all the cards he
wishes to know during the course of the game, as we
shall see further on.</p>

<p>§ B—<i>The marking of unprinted backs.</i>—It might
very naturally be supposed, that the application of any
system of marking to the backs of those cards which are
of an even tint, without pattern, would be a very difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
operation. Such, however, is by no means the case.
One might think that any mark, however slight, placed
upon the plain white back of a 'club-card,' must
inevitably be discovered sooner or later. Such an idea,
nevertheless, would indicate a very scant acquaintance
with the resources which are available to the card-sharper.</p>

<p>One of the earliest methods of marking of which
there is any record was used in connection with this
class of card. The incident is related by Houdin, whose
account of the matter is to the following effect.</p>

<p>A card-sharper having been detected in cheating, a
great quantity of cards were found in his possession.
The authorities, thinking that there might possibly be
some preparation or falsification of them, sent them to
Houdin for examination. To all appearance, however,
the cards were perfectly genuine. He could detect
nothing amiss with them. But notwithstanding the
negative result of his investigation, he felt morally
certain that they must have been tampered with in some
way. He therefore persevered in his efforts to solve
the problem, but several weeks elapsed, and still he
found himself exactly in the position from which he
started. At length, disgusted by such prolonged and
repeated failure, he flung a pack of the cards carelessly
across the table at which he was sitting. Then, in an
instant, the long-sought revelation was presented to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
view. The cards were marked, and in a manner sufficiently
ingenious to arouse the investigator's enthusiasm
at the time, although the method employed might not
be thought so very high class nowadays. We have advanced
since then.</p>

<p>The cards in question were of the ordinary glazed
kind, and lying at some little distance upon the table
the light from the window was reflected from their backs.
This circumstance disclosed the fact that each one had a
small unglazed spot upon it, placed in such a position as
to indicate the suit and value. Fig. 4 will explain the
system at a glance.</p>

<p>The glaze is removed by the simple expedient of putting
a drop of water upon the required spot, and blotting
it off after a few seconds. Such a mark is quite invisible
under ordinary circumstances, but when the cards are
held at a suitable angle to the light, the unglazed spot is
readily apparent.</p>

<p>This, of course, is not the only method of producing
the desired effect. Sometimes the glaze is removed by
means of a sharp knife.</p>

<p>Another plan is to produce a shallow concavity at
the proper position by laying the card upon its face and
pressing upon it with the rounded end of a penholder
or some similar and convenient instrument. In fact,
anything which will cause a little variation in the reflection
of the light from the back of the card will suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The cards above referred to were merely 'picquet'
packs. Therefore there was nothing lower than the
'seven.' If it is necessary to mark a full pack, the lower
cards may be marked with two dots, as shown in fig. 4.</p>

<p>When unglazed, or 'steam-boat' cards were in
general use, a very efficient mode of marking was
devised. It was done by ruling lines on the backs with
a piece of paraffin wax. Fig. 3 shows the arrangement.</p>

<p>This method is of course the converse of the foregoing,
the object of using the wax being to impart a
glaze where none previously existed. As before, these
marks are only decipherable when the cards are held at
a proper angle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 327px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_049.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="136"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>—Unglazed Cards.</div>
</div>

<p>Cards marked as in fig. 3 would answer perfectly for
a game such as 'poker,' where the suit is of no
consequence. If it is required to give both suit and
value, another mark—a dot for example—could be added,
the position of which would give the necessary indication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
The ace, it will be observed, is not marked. In
most systems, either the ace or the two is indicated
by the absence of marking. The same thing applies to
the suits, it is only required to mark three out of the
four.</p>

<p>§ C—<i>Marking by dot and puncture.</i>—The main outlines
of this method will be understood from what has
already been said. If the unglazed spots are represented
by minute dots, the principle is practically the same.
The only difference is in connection with marking by
puncture. In this case the mark is made by pricking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the card with a very fine needle upon its face. This
raises a minute point or 'burr' upon the back, which
can be detected by passing the thumb across the back of
the card whilst dealing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_050.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="423"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>—Divisions indicating suit and value.</div>
</div>

<p>If a plate of metal the size of a playing-card is
divided at each end into parallelograms, after the manner
shown in fig. 4, these divisions will represent the positions
occupied by the puncture or dot in representing the
various suits and values. A small hole being drilled in
the centre of each parallelogram, the plate will serve for
a 'template' by means of which the cards may be
pierced in the correct places. The plate is laid upon
the face of the card, and a fine needle is pricked through
the proper hole, just far enough to raise the necessary
projection on the back of the card. One point at each
end, then, will serve to mark all the cards of a picquet
pack. If those cards which are lower than seven have
to be marked, two points may be taken. For instance,
a point in the top left-hand corner, together with one
three divisions further to the right, will indicate the six
of clubs. A point in the second space on the same line,
with one in the fifth space, will represent the five of clubs,
and so on. This is a very good system of marking for
many purposes. It takes only a short time to mark the
whole pack; the marks are invisible, and will escape the
closest scrutiny. But great practice is necessary to render
the touch sufficiently acute, and the perception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
small differences sufficiently delicate, to read the marks
with precision.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_052.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="420"><br>
  <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 5.</div>
</div>

<p>Another method whereby a single dot is made to
represent both suit and value of any card is illustrated
in fig. 5. In every ornamental back almost, there is
some portion of the pattern which is more or less of a
fan-shaped or radial design. If this should happen to
contain thirteen divisions, nothing is easier than to
assign to each one a value, and thus the entire suit is
represented by merely varying the position of the dot.
The suit is given by placing the dot nearer or farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from the centre. Fig. 5 is a diagram which illustrates
this method in its simplest form. A dot placed outside
the periphery of the design stands for 'spades,' one just
inside for 'hearts,' half-way between the two lines for
'diamonds,' and close to the inner circle it means
'clubs.' The value or 'size,' as it is called, is shown by
the radial line, opposite which the mark is placed.
Having followed this explanation, the reader will at once
perceive that the dot marked <i>a</i> (fig. 5) represents the
two of diamonds.</p>

<p>Of course it frequently happens that there is no part
of the pattern which contains thirteen divisions. Then,
either more than one design must be used, or the form
of the mark must be varied. Supposing there are only
six divisions available for the purpose, the six highest
cards can be indicated by a dot, the six next in order
by a small dash, and the last by a minute cross.</p>

<p>§ D—<i>Cards marked<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_053.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="[symbol: squiggle]" width="25" height="29">in manufacture.</i>—Given the
original conception of marked cards, and their practical
application to the needs of the sharper, the next step is,
obviously, the production of such wares commercially.
The desirability of being able to open a new pack of cards
and find them ready prepared for use, was too palpable
to be overlooked.</p>

<p>For a long time the existence of such cards was
kept profoundly secret among a very few sharpers, and
those 'in the know' reaped a rich harvest. Nowadays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
however, these things are, comparatively speaking,
'common objects of the sea-shore.'</p>

<p>Fig. 6 is a reproduction of the first pattern ever
supplied, ready marked, by the makers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_054.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="260"><br>
  <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 6.</div>
</div>

<p>The distinctive marking was arranged by causing the
end of the scroll, marked '<i>a</i>,' to assume various forms,
and point in different directions.</p>

<p>This card did very well for a time; but the mark
was very obtrusive and the pattern became obsolete,
being discarded, in fact, for improved forms which were
of later invention.</p>

<p>The next step in the way
of improvement came with
the introduction of the plaid-back
cards, at one time
largely used. It was soon
discovered that these lent
themselves readily to the purposes of falsification, and
the result was the invention of a mark both easy to
read and not liable to detection. Like so many other
good things, it is marvellous in its simplicity. It is
based partly upon modification of the pattern, and
partly upon the position occupied by the mark. Fig. 7
illustrates a complete suit of these cards.</p>

<p>The higher cards commence with a set of five
parallel lines, placed somewhat to the left of the top
right-hand corner. The space between the first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
second lines is increased to indicate an ace; between
the second and third, a king; between the third and
fourth, a queen; and between the fourth and fifth, a
knave. For the ten, nine, eight, and seven, the pattern
is so arranged that the indicating lines terminate at the
corner of the card. These being similarly treated,
correspond with the four cards of that group. The six,
five, four, and three, are respectively given by a similar
band, which is so placed that it terminates upon the
right hand side of the card, immediately below the top
corner. The two is known by the fact of the card
being unmarked; that is to say, the lines of all the bands
are an equal distance apart, and are not tampered with
in any way.</p>

<p>The suit is given by a band of lines, terminating
some little distance below the top left-hand corner, on
the left of the card. The first space (counting from the
top) being widened, signifies a diamond; the second, a
heart; the third, a club; and the fourth, a spade. If
the reader has made the progress in 'sharping' which
might reasonably be expected at this stage of his instruction,
he should have no difficulty in distinguishing
the suit of the ace in fig. 7. It is evidently the ace of
clubs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 616px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_056.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="517"><br>
  <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 7.</div>
</div>

<p>This pattern is of especial value to the man who
can deal 'seconds,'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> as in giving off the 'draft' at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
poker, and so on, by keeping the pack spread out a
little, he can read off the values of the first four or
five cards. That is the great advantage in having
marks which come quite close to the edge.</p>

<p>We will conclude this subject of printed backs with a
description of one of the best designs ever made (fig. 8).
This pattern is particularly easy to read, even at a
considerable distance, yet it is certainly not liable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
detection by the uninitiated. To anyone who knows the
secret, it appears strange that a pack of these cards may
be given to a novice for examination, with the information
that they are marked, and he will never find anything
wrong with them. He may even examine them with a
microscope, yet he will see nothing amiss. The reason
is that he does not know what to look for. Most
probably he will expect to find dots or marks, <i>put on</i>
the card by hand. He might thus detect 'scroll work,'
examples of which are given further on, though most
likely 'shading' would escape his notice from the fact
that it is something for which he is not prepared.</p>

<p>In this instance the distinguishing marks are two in
number, one for suit and one for value. These are respectively
indicated by variations in the form of the two
small sprays in the left hand corner, round which lines
have been drawn in the upper card (fig. 8).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_057.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="600"><br>
  <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 8.</div>
</div>

<p>The lower of the two sprays is caused to show the suit
by being curved up or down, or having its termination
formed into a suggestion of a spade or a heart, as will be
seen on reference to the figure.</p>

<p>The upper spray is variously altered to denote the
values. Thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 645px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_058.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="122"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 9.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Cards marked in printing have of late years been
virtually abandoned in America, owing to the fact that
they are readily detected, even by those who are utterly
unable to discover the marks. The general appearance
of the cards is sufficient to show their origin. In the
first place, the ink with which the cards are printed is as
a rule very inferior; and secondly, the 'ace of spades'
has <span class="smcap">not</span> the maker's name upon it. As the maker himself
would say—'What do <i>you</i> think?'</p>

<p>Fig. 10 is a comparison of the ace of spades from a
genuine pack with that from a pack of manufactured
'marked backs.' It will be seen that the marked card
bears the title of a purely hypothetical 'Card Company.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_060.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="346"><br>

  <span style="float: right; padding-right: 2em;">Manufactured Marked-back.</span>

  <p class="p0 caption p2 smcap">Fig. 10.</p>
</div>

<p>By referring to the price-lists given towards the end
of this book, one finds that the price at which they are
quoted is by no means exorbitant, when one bears in
mind the risk which the maker runs, and the fact that he
has to go to the expense of fifty-two plates for printing
the backs, as against the one only which is required
for genuine cards. In revenge, and to keep down the
cost of production, he uses ink of a very inferior
quality to that employed by good firms. Thus, the
cards are rendered open to suspicion from the first, and
no doubt this has much to do with their falling into
disuse.</p>

<p>In America their employment is confined chiefly to
mining camps, where one may still find 'saloons' which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
are stocked entirely with this kind of 'paper,' as the cards
are called.</p>

<p>England, however, must be a fine field for them, as
card players here are really so ignorant that the subtle
methods of cheating would be thrown away. The best
work is not necessary, and the sharp who went to the
trouble of adopting it would be simply wasting his substance
on the desert air. There is little doubt that these
cards are largely used over here.</p>

<p>§ E—<i>Shading and tint-marking.</i>—Manufactured cards
having fallen into comparative desuetude, the reasonable
inference is that they have been supplanted by something
better; and such is the fact. In the hands of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
men they have been superseded by genuine cards,
marked (generally by the sharp himself) either with
'shading' or 'line-work.'</p>

<p>The earliest method of shading, so far as can be
ascertained, consisted of the application to plain-backed
cards of an even tint which, being rendered more or less
deep, denoted the values of certain cards. This tint was
produced by rubbing the card with a rag, lightly impregnated
with plumbago, until the required depth of tint was
obtained. This imperfect method, however, has gradually
developed into others which can hardly be said to leave
anything to be desired—at least from the sharp's point of
view.</p>

<p>At the present time shading is principally confined, if
not entirely so, to ornamental backs. It is effected by
applying a faint wash of colour to a fairly large portion of
the card. This colour of course must be one which
approximates to the tint of the card, and further, it must
be one which will dry without removing the glaze.</p>

<p>Just as there has been continual warfare between the
makers of heavy guns and the inventors of armour-plating,
so there has been a long struggle between the
playing-card manufacturer and the professional gambler.
Whilst the latter has been engaged in the endeavour to
concoct a stain with which he could shade his cards
without spoiling the enamel or altering the colour, the
former has done his best to circumvent the sharp's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
endeavours by compounding the glaze of ingredients
which will spoil the 'little game.' For some time the
manufacturer triumphed, and it became known that
Hart's red 'Angel-backs' were unstainable. Alas!
however, vice—and, shall we say science—was victorious,
and one can now buy a fluid warranted to stain any card
for a mere trifle.</p>

<p>These fluids are nothing more than solutions in
spirit of various aniline dyes. For red, aurosine is used,
and for blue aniline blue. Stafford's red ink, diluted with
spirit, produces a perfect stain for red cards. Others as
good can be made with the 'Diamond' dyes.</p>

<p>A suitable solution having been obtained, the cards
are shaded, either by putting a wash over a certain spot
or by washing over the whole of the back with the
exception of one spot. The latter method is the better
of the two in many respects, as the cards can be
distinguished at a distance of two or three yards, and yet
will bear the strictest examination, even at the hands of
one who understands the former method. In fact, the
closer one looks at the cards the less likely one is to
discover the mark, or, as the sharp would say, to
'tumble' to the 'fake.'</p>

<p>The directions for use issued with the shading fluids
will be found on page 302.</p>

<p>As the delicate tints of shaded work are lost in
reproduction, satisfactory examples cannot be given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
On the opposite page, however, will be found an illustration
of one method of shading the familiar 'angel-back'
card represented in fig. 11.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 527px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_063.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="400"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—Angel-back.</div>
</div>

<p>The shading in fig. 12 has been considerably
exaggerated, to render it apparent.</p>

<div id="fallenangels" class="figcenter" style="width: 545px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_064.jpg" alt="" width="545" height="327"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—'FALLEN ANGELS'</div>
</div>

<p>The little 'angel' (<i>a</i>, fig. 11) is made to indicate the
value of the cards by shading the head for an ace; the
right wing for a king; the left wing for a queen; the right
arm for a knave, and so on. The two is not marked.</p>

<p>The suit of the card is denoted by shading various
portions of the foliated design adjacent to the 'angel'
(<i>b</i>, fig. 11).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
With the exception of the exaggerated shading, these
marks are facsimiles of those upon a pack purchased
from one of the dealers, all of whom supply them.
Although the cards can be bought ready shaded, most
sharpers prefer to do them for themselves. Therefore, they
merely buy the marking-fluids, and invent their own
marks.</p>

<p>§ F—<i>Line and scroll work.</i>—This is the kind of
marking which is adopted by the most expert among
card-sharpers. When well done it can hardly be detected
even by another sharper.</p>

<p>This system may be briefly summarised as follows.
Some convenient portion of the card-back is selected—a
flower or some similar device in the pattern, for instance—and
a shading consisting of very fine lines, in imitation
of the normal shading of the pattern, is used, its position
indicating the value of the card. A specially prepared
'line-work fluid' is used, and the work is put on with a
fine pen or, better still, with a fine sable pencil. In
using a pen there is always a danger of scratching the
enamel, but by the use of a 'photographic sable,' such
as retouchers employ, this is obviated.</p>

<p>In order to imbue the reader with a due appreciation
of these works of art, our first example shall be one of a
very obvious character; one that could only be used in
a 'soft game.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> We shall then have an opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
comparing it with one or two of the masterpieces of the
century, and, looking back upon the earlier pages of this
book, we can reflect upon the manner in which the
science of card-sharping is progressing, like other and
more legitimate sciences.</p>

<p>A portion of the pattern, consisting of five projections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
is usually chosen in line-marking, and the line-work
is applied in the following manner. The first
projection, or petal, on the left, is shaded to denote an
ace; the second a king; the third a queen; the fourth a
knave; and the fifth a ten. Then for a nine, the first
and second are shaded; for an eight the second and
third; and so on to the six. Lastly, taking the foliations
in groups of three, the first three represent the five; the
second, third, and fourth, the four; and the third, fourth,
and fifth, the three. The two is not shaded.</p>

<p>In the case of the card which is reproduced in fig. 13,
the spray of leaves marked <i>a</i> would be chosen to indicate
the values. The spray <i>b</i> would be shaded to denote the
suit. Reference to fig. 14 will serve to make this clear.</p>

<p>Having mastered this elementary method, we will
now turn to some of the finest work that has ever been
put upon cards. Fig. 15 illustrates five cards of the
'angel-back' pattern. These are respectively the king,
queen, knave, ten, and nine. It is not too much to say
that the mark would never be discovered without assistance
being given, by one previously acquainted with it.</p>

<p>As a concluding example of line-work, if the reader

leaf would be selected for the purpose, and shaded
with line-work after the manner of fig. 17.</p>

<p><i>Cards marked whilst in play.</i>—We now arrive at
the last subdivision of this branch of our subject, and
perhaps the one which will prove most generally interesting,
viz. the possibility of placing distinctive marks
upon the cards during the course of the game. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
average reader may probably be surprised to learn that
such a practice has been resorted to by sharpers from
time immemorial. Further, its accomplishment presents
not the slightest difficulty, in fact it is the simplest thing
in the world.</p>

<p>The earliest method appears to have been that of
raising a slight burr upon the edges of the cards with an
instrument provided—perhaps for that purpose(?)—by
Nature, to wit, the thumb-nail. This and other primitive
methods alike have been superseded by others more
scientific. Therefore we will not waste our time in
detailing such elementary matters, but pass on to the
means used at the present day.</p>

<p>One of the simplest appliances is the 'nail prick,'
quoted in the price-lists at half a dollar. This is simply
a tiny piece of metal, carrying a point, which is held
when in use under the thumb-nail of the right hand.
With this point the cards can be pricked without observation,
in positions which will indicate the suit and value.
It is, however, not much used.</p>

<p>Pricking the cards is a method chiefly employed by
men who can deal 'seconds.' The sharp will prick the
corners of all the aces and court cards, or as many of them
as happen to fall into his hands, from time to time; and
whilst dealing, he can feel the little projection caused by
the prick, and hold these cards back till they could be
dealt to himself. One who did this every time it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to his turn to deal must inevitably win all the money
sooner or later. No sharp, however, would be insane
enough to arouse suspicion in this manner.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 109px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_074.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="152"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 18.</span>
</div>

<p>The most refined and scientific method of pricking
the cards is by means of an ingenious little appliance,
known as the 'poker-ring.' This is an ordinary finger-ring,
having attached to it upon the under side a needle-point
of about one sixty-fourth of an inch in length
(fig. 18). In the illustration, the length of
the point is exaggerated.</p>

<p>As the cards are held in the hand,
the corner of any one which it is desired
to mark is simply pressed against the point
with the thumb of either hand. Thus with
one hand the sharp is enabled to mark
any card he chooses, under the very eyes of his adversaries,
and without a single suspicious movement being
observable.</p>

<p>But the greatest advance in this direction was made
when the art of marking cards with shade-work was discovered.
It was found that a little aniline colour, taken
upon the tip of the finger, could be transferred to the
back of a card slightly deepening the tint in the spot to
which it was applied. The colour was at first derived
from a piece of blue aniline pencil, carried in the pocket,
and upon the point of which the finger was secretly
rubbed. As far as one can ascertain, the English sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
has not progressed beyond this point in his professional
knowledge. In America, however, it is otherwise.
Across the water, superior intelligences soon concocted a
coloured paste which would answer the purpose much
better. Scooping a hole in a piece of cork, the cavity
was filled with the composition, and the cork was sewn
inside the lower edge of the waistcoat. In this position
the colour was convenient to the hand.</p>

<p>The idea thus conceived has been improved upon
until one may say that this method has reached perfection
in the form of appliances known
as 'shading boxes.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 152px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_075.jpg" alt="" width="152" height="176"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 19.</span>
</div>

<p>These implements of chicanery,
of which fig. 19 is an illustration, are
little nickel-plated boxes, which are
completely filled with the coloured
composition. In the centre of the lid
is a slot through which the colour is
pressed. The finger being passed over this slot, takes
up a little of the colour. The base of the box is pierced
around the circumference with small holes, for convenience
in sewing it to the inside of the waistcoat or
underneath the flap of a side pocket, as may be preferred.
The boxes are generally used in pairs, one containing
red composition and the other blue. With these two
colours, almost every coloured card can be marked. The
paste for refilling the boxes is supplied separately, or, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the sharp is acquainted with its composition, he may
make it for himself. Here is the recipe.</p>

<p>Olive oil, stearine, and camphor are incorporated in a
melted condition with aniline of the required hue. The
mixture is then poured out upon a level surface and
allowed to cool. When cold it is worked up with the
blade of a knife upon a sheet of white paper, to get rid
of the superfluous oil. It is then ready for use.</p>

<p>Marking placed upon cards in this way can be instantly
removed by merely rubbing the card upon the
table-cloth.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that these boxes are considered
to be so good that they are not included in the catalogues
of dealers in so-called 'sporting-goods.' They
are kept as a secret among those who are 'in the know.'</p>

<p>These convenient little articles, then, bring us to the
end of the systems of marking. It only remains to instruct
the neophyte who has followed the course of our
lessons so far, in the methods of utilising the marks
when once they are placed upon the cards.</p>

<p>Those familiar words of the great artist who said that
the medium he employed in mixing his colours was
'brains,' may find an echo in the directions for playing
marked cards. They must be used with intelligence or
not at all. Indeed, great circumspection is requisite in
utilising the information which the marks provide. In
a game of whist, for instance, a thorough-paced player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would at once detect any glaring peculiarity of play
resulting from knowledge surreptitiously acquired. One
may know, perfectly well, which card in one's hand would
win the trick, but it is not always advisable to play it.
Tact and judgment, added to a thorough acquaintance
with the rules of the game which is being played, are
necessary adjuncts to the successful employment of any
system of cheating.</p>

<p>In a round game, when it is your turn to deal, you
may read the cards as you deal them; and in this way
know the hands of your opponents, or at any rate the
principal cards. In a single-handed game you can
remember the whole of your antagonist's cards, but
with more than two players it is not advisable to attempt
to commit to memory more than one hand. That, preferably,
should be the hand of the 'flattest man,' the
'greatest mug,' the man who is playing highest, or your
most dangerous opponent. With a little practice the top
card of the pack can be read, just before it is dealt.
There is plenty of time for this whilst the previous card
is on its way to the table. In a game such as Poker,
where the suit is of no consequence, you simply repeat
to yourself the value of the card as you deal it, and
from your knowledge of the game you may deduce the
discards from that particular hand. Then, in giving off
the 'draft'—<i>i.e.</i> the cards to replace those which have
been discarded, and which, of course, you have not seen—you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
read the cards as they are given out. In this way
you can form a tolerably accurate opinion as to what
cards that hand finally contains. If your hand happens
to be better, you can bet against this particular player,
continually raising the stakes until all the other players
are 'raised out.' That is to say, they do not feel inclined
to risk so much money on their hands, and therefore
they throw them down, and leave the game, for the
moment, in the hands of the two highest players.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the top card may be utilised in
dealing 'seconds.' The top card, being one which you
require, may be kept back until it comes to your turn
either on the deal or the draft. This, however, is a very
bad way of using marked cards. It is sure to be
detected sooner or later, and then your only course
will be to 'clear out' from the scene of your former
victories. Whilst, if you confine your attention to the use
of the information given by the marks, trusting to your
wits rather than to the deftness of your fingers, you will
not only win but 'last.'</p>

<p>Working with shaded cards, in which the shading
occupies the greater portion of the card, many of your
opponents' cards can be read as they hold them in their
hands; especially where they are held spread out, as is
so often the case in England.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the game, marked cards will often
enable you to win where you otherwise would lose, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
long as due care and judgment are exercised. For example,
at Vingt-et-un, you will always know whether it is
advisable to draw another card or not. You will not
stand in doubt as to the card you will get. At Baccarat
you will know what cards you have given the players,
and what you will draw if you take one. Too many
false drafts, however, are liable to create suspicion; so in
this game you must be careful in your proceedings. At
Loo, you will have a strong advantage, as you will always
know the contents of the hand upon the table, and
when to take 'miss.' In games such as 'Banker' or
'Polish Bank,' which consist of betting that you have in
your hand a card (not seen) which will beat one that has
been turned up, you have to contend with no uncertainty
whatever.</p>

<p>Having pursued our subject to this point, it cannot be
denied that we have learnt something of great importance,
viz. that among the advantages enjoyed by us
in this nineteenth century, we must not overlook those
embodied in the fact, that not only are marked cards
articles of commerce, readily obtainable at the right
places, but we have also the means of falsifying genuine
cards, of any pattern, at a few minutes' notice. Even
failing this, we have at our command means of marking
all the cards which it is necessary to know whilst under
the very noses of our antagonists.</p>

<p>The practical philosopher—if such exist—whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
meditating upon the benefits accruing to mankind from
civilisation, should by no means forget that, in one
notable instance at least—card-playing to wit—civilisation
has provided the means of eliminating from the
affairs of life the undesirable and inconvenient element
of chance. There is no such thing as chance, says the
predestinationist; and certainly in some cases the truth
is with him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>REFLECTORS</i></span></h2>

<p>Although there can be no question as to the utility of
marked cards in the hands of the sharper, it frequently
happens that he is unable to avail himself of the advantages
presented by their employment. It may be, perhaps,
that he is so situated as to be compelled to use
genuine cards belonging to someone else; and that, the
comparatively scanty and hurried marking supplied by
means of poker-ring or shading box will not provide him
with all the information imperatively demanded by the
nature of the game in which he is engaged. He may,
perhaps, be playing in circles where the devices of marking,
and the methods of accomplishing it, are well known.
For many reasons the use of marked cards may be too
risky to be ventured upon; or the cards themselves may
not be available at the moment. Again, the sharp may
not have taken the trouble to master any system of marking;
yet, for all that, he requires a knowledge of his
opponent's cards just as much as his more talented
brother of the pen, the brush, and the needle-point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
How then, it may be asked, is he to obtain this knowledge?
Simply—very simply. The sharp needs to be
hard pressed indeed, to be driven to the end of his
tether.</p>

<p>Marked cards being out of the question, it is possible
to obviate to a great extent the necessity for them by
the use of certain little instruments of precision denominated
'reflectors,' or, more familiarly, 'shiners.'
These are not intended to be used for the purpose of
casting reflections upon the assembled company. Far
from it. Their reflections are exclusively such as have
no weight with the majority. They, and their use alike,
reflect only upon the sharp himself.</p>

<p>These useful little articles are constructed in many
forms, and are as perfectly adapted to the requirements
of the individual as are the works of Nature herself.
Just as man has been evolved in the course of ages
from some primitive speck of structureless protoplasm,
so, in like manner, we find that these convexities of
silvered glass have crystallised out from some primordial
drop of innocent liquid, more or less accidentally spilled
upon the surface of a table in years gone by.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the origin of the reflector. The sharp
of long ago was content to rely upon a small circular drop
of wine, or whatever he happened to be drinking, carefully
spilled upon the table immediately in front of him.
Holding the cards over this drop, their faces would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
reflected from its surface, for the information of the sharp
who was dealing them.</p>

<p>Times have advanced since then, however, and the
sharp has advanced with the times. We live in an age
of luxury. We are no longer satisfied with the rude
appliances which sufficed for the simpler and less
fastidious tastes of our forefathers; and in this respect
at least the sharp is no exception to the general rule.
He, too, has become more fastidious, and more exacting
in his requirements, and his tastes are more expensive.
His reflector, therefore, is no longer a makeshift; it is a
well-constructed instrument, both optically and mechanically,
costing him, to purchase, from two and a half to
twenty-five dollars. Not shillings, bear in mind, but
dollars. Think of it! Five pounds for a circular piece
of looking-glass, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter!
The fact that such a price is paid is sufficient to
indicate the profitable character of the investment.</p>

<p>The first record we have of the employment of a
specially constructed appliance of this kind describes
a snuff-box bearing in the centre of the lid a small
medallion containing a portrait. The sharp in taking a
pinch of snuff pressed a secret spring, the effect of which
was to substitute for the portrait a convex reflector. The
snuff-box then being laid upon the table the cards were
reflected from the surface of this mirror, giving the
sharp a reduced image of each one as it was dealt. A device<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of this kind may have passed muster years ago, but it
could never escape detection nowadays. At the present
day card-players would be, unquestionably, 'up to snuff.'</p>

<p>Among the more modern appliances, the first to which
we shall refer is that known as the 'table-reflector.'
As its name implies, it is designed for the purpose of
being attached to the card-table during the game. It is
thus described in one of the price-lists.</p>

<p>'<i>Table-reflector.</i>—Fastens by pressing steel spurs into
under side of table. A fine glass comes to the edge
of table to read the cards as you deal them off. You
can set the glass at any angle or turn it back out of
sight in an instant.'</p>

<p>From the many samples similar to the above with
which one meets in 'sporting' literature, the legitimate
inference is that punctuation-marks are an expensive
commodity in certain districts of America.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_084.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="161"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 20.</span>
</div>

<p>The reflector to which this paragraph refers is
illustrated in fig. 20. It is a neat little contrivance,
nicely finished and nickel-plated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The mirror <i>m</i> is convex, forming as usual a reduced
image of the card. A represents the position of the
reflector whilst in use. B shows the manner in which
it is turned back, out of the way and out of sight. The
hinge is fitted with light friction-springs, which enable the
mirror to retain any position in which it may be placed.</p>

<p>The correct way to 'play' the reflector is to press the
steel point into the under side of the table, just sufficiently
far back to bring the hinge about level with the lower edge
of the table top. Whilst in use, the mirror, contrary to
what one might suppose, is not inclined downwards, but
the inclination given to it is an upward one as in the
illustration. Thus, whilst the sharp is leaning slightly
forward, as one naturally would, whilst dealing, the cards
are reflected from the mirror as he looks back into it.</p>

<p>Used in this manner, the reflector can be played anywhere,
and even those who are familiar with 'shiners'
will 'stand' it. Inclined downwards, it may be easier to
use, but in that case the dealer would have to lean back
whilst distributing the cards. A proceeding such as that
would be liable to attract attention and to arouse suspicions
which, all things considered, had better be allowed
to slumber if the sharp is to maintain that mental quietude
so necessary to the carrying out of his plans. It is
possible of course that nothing of the kind may occur,
but, on the other hand, it might. One cannot be too
careful, when even the most innocent actions are apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
be misconstrued. The world is so uncharitable, that a
little thing like the discovery of a bit of looking-glass
might lead to a lot of unpleasantness. Who knows?</p>

<p>Should anyone happen to come behind the dealer
whilst the mirror is in view, it can always be turned out of
sight with the little finger in the act of taking up one's
cards from the table, or by sitting very close it can be
altogether concealed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 134px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_086.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="132"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 21.</span>
</div>

<p>Another very efficient form of reflector is one so constructed
as to be adaptable to the interior
of a pipe-bowl. It consists of a
small convex mirror, similar to the one
used in the table reflector, which is
cemented to a piece of cork shaped to
fit inside the bowl of an ordinary briar-root
pipe (fig. 21).</p>

<p>Such a device is more adapted to the requirements of
the second or third-rate sharper, as it would not be available
in a circle of cigarette-smoking 'Johnnies.' It is
used in the following manner.</p>

<p>The 'shiner' is carried separately from the pipe, and
held until required in the palm of the hand, with the cork
downwards. The sharp having finished his pipe, stoops
down to knock out the ashes, upon any convenient spot.
As the hand is again brought up to the level of the table,
the glass is pressed into the bowl of the pipe with the
thumb. The pipe is then laid upon the table, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bowl facing towards its owner, a little to the left of where
he is sitting. In this position the mirror is visible to no
one but the sharp himself. He is therefore at liberty to
make the freest use of it without exciting suspicion in the
least.</p>

<div id="pipe" class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_088.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="158"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>—PIPE-REFLECTOR <i>IN SITU</i></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 22 is a photograph of pipe and mirror <i>in situ</i>,
which will give a far better idea of the convenience of this
arrangement than any amount of explanation could
possibly enable the reader to form. The card which is
seen reflected in miniature was held at a distance from
the mirror of about six inches.</p>

<p>Among the various forms in which reflectors are supplied,
there are some attached to coins and rouleaux of
coins of various values. Also there are some so constructed
as to be attached to a pile of 'greenbacks' or bank-notes.
The manner in which these are used will be readily
understood, therefore there is no need to do more than
refer to them. In addition to these, there is the appliance
described in the catalogue as—'Reflector, attached to
machine, can be brought to palm of hand at will.' This
will be found described in the chapter on 'holdouts,' to
which class of apparatus it properly belongs.</p>

<p>The smallest and most difficult to use of all reflectors
is one the very existence of which is but little known,
even among sharps, viz. the tooth-pick reflector. In
this instance the mirror is a very tiny one adapted to lie
at an angle within the interior of a large quill tooth-pick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
With the exception of its size, it is similar in other
respects to the pipe-reflector already described. Needless
to say, the extreme minuteness of the image formed
by so small a mirror entirely precludes its use except by
a sharp who is an expert
indeed, and one
whose vision is of the
keenest description:
<i>m</i>, fig. 23, indicates
the position occupied
by the mirror within the interior of the quill. The noble
bird—typical of all gamblers—from whose pinion the
feather has been extracted for so unworthy a purpose,
might well exclaim, 'To what base uses may we come!'</p>

<p>The operator who has adopted this form of instrument
will enter the room where card-players are
assembled, chewing his tooth-pick after the approved
Piccadilly fashion of a few years ago. Having taken
his place at the table, he throws down the tooth-pick in
front of him, with the pointed end turned towards him.
His mirror then comes into play, in the same manner as
that of the pipe-reflector aforesaid.</p>

<p>One form of reflector which is very useful to the
sharp in a single-handed game, is that mentioned in one
of the catalogues as being intended to stand behind a
pile of 'chips' or counters upon the table. It may
appear to the uninitiated that there would be great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
difficulty in concealing a mirror in this way. Such,
undoubtedly, would be the case if only one pile of chips
were used. By placing two piles side by side, however,
the difficulty disappears. With counters, say, an inch
and a quarter in diameter, there is ample space behind
two piles, when standing close together, to accommodate
and conceal a tolerably large reflector, as such
things go.</p>

<p>The mirror in this case is mounted somewhat after
the fashion of a linen-prover; and precisely resembles a
small hinge. The hinge being opened, reveals the
reflector. It is set at a suitable angle and simply laid
upon the table, either behind the rouleaux of counters,
as explained above, or behind a pile of bank-notes, as
may be most convenient. If the sharp should unhappily
be compelled to part with either counters or
notes—a circumstance, by the way, which should never
occur in the ordinary course of events—though accidents
will happen now and then—the reflector can be
closed up and secreted in an instant.</p>

<p>It is a neat little device, and one well worthy the
notice of intending purchasers. (<i>See advt.</i>)</p>

<p>In connection with sharping of any kind, as in every
other branch of art, whether sacred or profane, legal or
illegal, one fact is always distinctly noticeable. No
matter what improvements may be made, or what
amount of complexity may be introduced into any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
system, or into the appliances which have been invented
to meet its requirements, the practice of its leading
exponents always tends towards simplicity of operation.
To this rule there are very few exceptions. The greatest
minds are, as a rule, content to use the simplest methods.
Not the easiest, bear in mind, but the simplest. The
simple tools are generally more difficult to use with
effect than the more elaborate ones. The great painter
with no other tools than his palette-knife and his thumb
will produce work which could not be imitated by a man
of inferior talents, although he had the entire stock of
Rowney or Winsor and Newton at his disposal. So, in
like manner, is it with the really great expert in sharping.
With a small unmounted mirror, and a bit of cobbler's
wax, he will win more money than a duffer who possesses
the most perfect mechanical arrangement ever adapted
to a reflector. It is the quality of the man which tells,
not that of his tools.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be asked then, if the simplest
appliances are best, why is it that they are not generally
adopted, in place of the more complicated devices.
That, however, is just the same thing as asking why an
organ-grinder is content to wind out machine-made airs
during the whole of his existence, rather than to devote
his time to the far less expensive process of learning to
play an instrument. The answer is the same in both
cases. It is simply that machinery is made to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
place of skill. The machine can be obtained by the
expenditure of so much or so little money, whilst the
skill can only be obtained by a lifetime of practice.
Your duffer, as a rule, does not care about hard work.
He prefers a situation where all the hard work is put
out, and the less irksome is done by somebody else.
Hence the demand for cheating-tools which will throw
the responsibility of success or failure upon the manufacturer,
leaving the operator at liberty to acquire just
as much skill as he pleases, or to do without skill
altogether if he thinks fit.</p>

<p>According to one of the leading experts in America,
the above-mentioned bit of cobbler's wax, in conjunction
with the plain unmounted mirror, is by far the best
method of employing a reflector. The mirror is simply
attached, by means of the wax, to the palm of the hand
near the edge; and when it is fixed in this position, the
little indices, usually found upon the corners of modern
playing-cards, can be read quite easily. Furthermore,
so situated, the reflector is quite secure from observation.</p>

<p>The majority of sharps, however, appear to strike
the happy medium between the simplicity of this device
and the complexity of the 'reflector attached to machine.'
Thus, it is the table-reflector which appears to be the
most popular for general use, although from its nature
it is not well-adapted for use in a round game. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
are too many people to the right and left of the operator.
For a single-handed game, however, where the sharp
has no opportunity of 'getting his own cards in,' it is
invaluable.</p>

<p>Supposing, then, for the moment, gentle reader, that
you were a sharp, your plan of working the table-reflector
would be as follows. You would find your 'mug' (first
catch your hare), and perhaps you might induce him to
invite you to his club. Having got your hand in to this
extent, doubtless you would find means of persuading
him to engage you in a game of cards, 'just to pass the
time.' He thinks, no doubt, that he is perfectly safe, as
the club cards are being used, and moreover being in
all probability what is known in 'sporting' circles as a
'fly-flat'—that is, a fool who thinks himself wise—he
imagines that he knows enough about cheating to 'spot'
anyone who had the audacity to 'try it on' with him.
Now, if there is one thing more certain than another, it
is that a sharp is always safest in the hands of a man
who thinks he knows a lot. The event will nearly
always prove that his knowledge is limited to an
imperfect acquaintance with some of the older forms
of manipulation; things which have been discarded
as obsolete by all practical men. Therefore, if he
anticipates cheating at all, he prepares himself to look
out for something vastly different to what is about to
take place. His mind running in a groove, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
preoccupied with matters which are of no importance
to him; and thus falls an easy prey to the sharper.</p>

<p>In such a case, then, you have a 'soft thing.' You
select a table which affords you the opportunity of
securing a nice, convenient seat, with your back to the
wall. You fix your 'shiner' just under the edge of
the table, and engage your 'pigeon' in a single-handed
game of poker. If you are worth your salt, you ought
to pluck him—nay, <i>skin him</i>, for all he is worth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>HOLDOUTS</i></span></h2>

<p>The term 'Holdout' is the name given to a mechanical
contrivance, constructed with the object of enabling the
card-sharper to 'hold-out,' or conceal one or more cards,
until such time as he finds that they will be useful to
him by turning the balance of fortune in his favour
at some critical point of the game. They are obviously
unavailable in those games where the whole pack is distributed
among the players, as the cards abstracted
must in that case necessarily be missed.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that although the name may
appear clumsy and puerile, it is notwithstanding well
chosen and expressive. The gambler 'holds out'
inducements to the cheat; the market, provided by
cheating, 'holds out' inducements to the manufacturer;
the manufacturer 'holds out' inducements to purchase
his machines; and the machines themselves 'hold out'
inducements which very few sharpers can resist. It is
like the nursery-rhyme of the dog that was eventually
'purwailed on' to get over the stile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
As far as we have yet travelled upon our explorations
into the regions of fraud and chicanery, yclept 'sharping,'
our path has been, comparatively speaking, a rosy one.
The way has been by no means intricate, and the
difficulties we have had to encounter have been but
few. At this point, however, the course runs through
a region which is, to some extent, beset with thorn
and bramble, in the guise of mechanical contrivances
having a more or less complex character. The non-technical
reader, however, has no cause for being
appalled at the nature of the ground which he is invited
to traverse; the author undertakes to render his
travelling easy, and to put him through, as it were,
by 'Pullman-Express.' One should always endeavour
to popularise science whenever the opportunity serves.
The mechanically minded reader, at any rate, will revel
in the examples of human ingenuity—and corruptibility—which
are here presented for the first time to his admiring
gaze.</p>

<p>As in all other instances of means well-adapted to a
given end, these utensils of the holdout persuasion have
taken their origin from extremely simple and antiquated
devices. Perhaps we are not correct in saying 'extremely
antiquated,' since 'Cavendish' is of opinion that cards
have not been invented more than five hundred years.
Those, however, who attribute their invention to the
Chinese, æons before the dawn of western civilisation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
will be inclined to the belief that the 'Heathen Chinee'
of succeeding ages must have coerced the smiles of
fortune, with the friendly aid of a holdout, centuries
before the discovery of the land of that instrument's
second or third nativity.</p>

<p>As to this debatable point, however, there is very
little hope that we shall ever be better informed than at
present. It belongs to the dead things of the dead past;
it is shrouded in the mist of antiquity and buried
beneath the withered leaves of countless generations;
among which might be found the decayed refuse of
many a family tree, whose fall could be directly traced
to the invention of the deadly implements known as
playing cards. Do not let the reader imagine for a
moment that I am inveighing against the use of cards,
when employed as an innocent means of recreation.
That is not my intention by any means. Such a thing
would savour of narrow-mindedness and bigotry, and
should be discouraged in every possible way. The
means of rendering our existence here below as mutually
agreeable as circumstances will permit are by no means
so plentiful that we can afford to dispense with so
enjoyable a pastime as a game of cards. It is not the
fault of the pieces of pasteboard, that some people have
been ruined by their means; it is the fault of the players
themselves. Had cards never been invented, the
result would have been very similar. Those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
addicted to gambling, in the absence of cards, would
have spun coins, drawn straws, or engaged in some
other equally intellectual recreation. When a man has
arrived at the state of mind which induces him to make
'ducks and drakes' of his property, and a fool of
himself, there is no power on earth that can prevent
him from so doing.</p>

<p>But to return. The earliest account we have of anything
in the holdout line is the cuff-box described by
Houdin. I for one, however, am inclined to think that
there is a slight tinge of the apocryphal in the record as
given by him. My reason for this opinion is twofold.
In the first place the description is singularly lacking in
detail, considering Houdin's mechanical genius; and
secondly, the difficulty of constructing and using such an
apparatus would be for all practical purposes insuperable.
I should say that Houdin had never seen the
machine; and that he trusted too implicitly to hearsay,
without exercising his judgment. Of course there
is nothing but internal evidence to support this view;
still, I cannot help believing that part at least of the
great Frenchman's account must be taken 'cum
grano.' In any event, however, we are bound to
admit that something in the nature of a holdout was
known to some persons in the early part of the present
century.</p>

<p>Houdin entitles the device above referred to—'La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
boite à la manche;' and his description is to the following
effect.</p>

<p>A box sufficiently large to contain a pack of cards
was concealed somewhere in the fore part of the sharp's
coat-sleeve. In picking up the pack, preparatory to
dealing, the forearm was lightly pressed upon the table.
The box was so constructed that this pressure had the effect
of throwing out the prepared or pre-arranged pack
previously put into it, and at the same time a pair of pincers
seized the pack in use, and withdrew it to the interior of
the box, in exchange for the one just ejected. In his
autobiography, Houdin recounts an incident in which
this box played a prominent part. A sharp had utilised
it with great success for some time, but at last the day
came when his unlucky star was in the ascendant. The
pincers failed to perform their function properly, and
instead of removing the genuine pack entirely, they left
one card upon the table. From the description given of
the apparatus, one may imagine that such a contingency
would be very likely to arise. The dupe of course discovered
the extra card, accused the sharp of cheating—and
not without reason, it must be admitted—challenged
him to a duel, and shot him. Serve him right, you say?
Well, we will not contest the point.</p>

<p>The substitution of one pack for another appears to
be the earliest conception of anything approximate to the
process of holding-out cards until they are required. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sorts of pockets, in every conceivable position, appear to
have been utilised by the sharps of long ago, for the purpose
of concealing the packs which they sought to introduce
into the game. This necessarily could only be done
at a period when plain-backed cards were generally used.
The sharp of to-day would want a goodly number of
pockets, if it were necessary for him to be able to replace
any pattern among the cards which he might be called
upon to use.</p>

<p>Holding out, however, in the true sense of the term,
became a power in the hands of the sharp only with the
introduction, and the reception into popular favour, of
games such as Poker, in which the cards are not all dealt out,
and the possession of even one good card, in addition to
a hand which, apart from fraud, proves to be decent, is
fraught with such tremendous advantages to the sharp who
has contrived to secrete it.</p>

<p>The earliest example of a card being systematically
held out until it could be introduced into the game with
advantage to the player, is probably that of the sharp who,
during play, was always more or less afflicted with weariness,
and consequently with a perpetual desire to stretch
himself and yawn. It was noticed after a while that he
always had a good hand after yawning; a singular fact,
and unaccountable. Doubtless the occultists of that day
sought to establish some plausible connection between
the act of stretching and the caprices of chance. If so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
there is very little question that, according to their usual
custom, they discovered some super-normal, and (to themselves)
satisfactory hypothesis, to account for the influence
of lassitude upon the fortunes of the individual. In
accordance with the usual course of events in such
instances, however, the occult theory would be unable to
retain its hold for long. The super-normal always resolves
itself into the normal, when brought under the influence
of practical common-sense. In this particular case the
explanation was of the simplest. Having secreted a card
in the palm of his hand, the sharp, under cover of the act
of stretching, would just stick it under the collar of his
coat as he sat with his back to the wall. When the card
was required for use, a second yawn with the accompanying
stretch would bring it again into his hand.
This, then, was the first real holdout—the back of a
man's coat collar.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Since that time the ingenuity of the cheating community
has been unremittingly applied to the solution
of the problem of making a machine which would enable
them to hold out cards without risk of detection. That
their efforts have been crowned with complete success
we have the best of reasons for believing, inasmuch as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>holdouts which can be used without a single visible
movement being made, and without the least fear of
creating suspicion, are articles of commerce at the present
moment. You have only to write to one of the dealers,
inclosing so many dollars, and you can be set up for
life. No doubt you can obtain the names and addresses
of these gentlemen without difficulty; but since the
object of this book is not to supply them with gratuitous
advertisement, their local habitation will not be
given herein, although their wares are prominently
mentioned.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may fully appreciate the
beauty and value of the latest and most improved devices,
we will run lightly over the gamut of the various instruments
which have been introduced from time to time.
This course is the best to pursue, since even among the
earlier appliances there are some which, if well-worked,
are still to be relied upon in certain companies, and indeed
<i>are</i> relied upon by many a sharp who considers
himself 'no slouch.'</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that the first contrivance
which proved to be of any practical use was one
designated by the high-sounding and euphonious title of
'The Bug.' Your sharp has always an innate sense of
the fitness of things, and an unerring instinct which
prompts him to reject all things but those which are
beautiful and true. Ample evidence of this is not wanting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
even in such simple matters as the names he gives
to the tools employed in his handicraft.</p>

<p>'The Bug' would appear to be an insect which may
be relied upon at all times, and in whose aid the fullest
confidence may be placed. In fact, there is a saying to
the effect that the bug has never been known to fail the
enterprising naturalist who has been fortunate enough to
secure a specimen, and that it has never been detected in
use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_104.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="91"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>—'The Bug.'</div>
</div>

<p>This entomological curiosity is illustrated in fig. 24,
and is thus described in the catalogue of one indefatigable
collector.</p>

<p>'The Bug.' A little instrument easily carried in your
vest pocket, that can be used at a moment's notice to hold
out one or more cards in any game. Simple yet safe
and sure. Price $1,00.</p>

<p>Such then are the general characteristics of the
species; but since the reader will probably desire a more
intimate acquaintance with its habits and its structural
details, the following description is appended.</p>

<p>In its essential features the bug is simply a straight
piece of watchspring, bent—as Paddy might say—at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
end. The end nearest the bend is inserted into the
handle of a very small shoemaker's awl. There is
nothing else 'to it' whatever. The point of the awl is
stuck into the under side of the table, in such a manner
that the spring lies flat against the table top, or nearly so,
the point of the spring projecting beyond the edge of
the table to the extent of about one-eighth of an inch.</p>

<p>The cards having been dealt out (say for Poker),
the sharp takes up those which have fallen to his hand,
and stands them on edge upon the table, with their faces
towards him, holding them with both hands. The
card or cards which he wishes to hold out are then
brought in front of the others, and with the thumbs they
are quietly slid under the table between it and the spring.
In this position they are perfectly concealed, and may be
allowed to remain until required. When again wanted,
these cards are simply pulled out by the two thumbs,
as the sharp draws his other cards towards him with a
sweeping motion. Thus, by selecting a good card here
and there, as the succeeding hands are played, the sharp
acquires a reserve of potential energy sufficient to overcome
a great deal of the inertia with which he would
otherwise be handicapped by the fluctuations of fortune.</p>

<p>The next form of holdout which falls beneath our
notice is that known as the 'Cuff Holdout.' Let us see
how the genius of the maker describes it.</p>

<p>'Cuff Holdout. Weighs two ounces, and is a neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
invention to top the deck, to help a partner, or hold out
a card playing Stud Poker, also good to play the half
stock in Seven Up. This holdout works in shirt
sleeves and holds the cards in the same place as a cuff-pocket.
There is no part of the holdout in sight at
any time. A man that has worked a pocket will appreciate
this invention. Price, by registered mail, $10,00.'</p>

<p>The cuff-pocket, above alluded to, was a very early
invention. As its name indicates, it was a pocket inside
the coat sleeve, the opening to which was situated on the
under side at the seam
joining sleeve and cuff.
In fig. 25 '<i>a</i>' denotes
the opening of the
pocket.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_106.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="74"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 25.</span>
</div>

<p>In a game of
Poker it would be employed as follows. Whilst
shuffling the cards, the sharp would contrive to get
three of a kind at the top of the pack. He would
then insert his little finger between these three cards and
the rest, the pack being in the left hand. Then holding
his hand in front of him he would reach across it with
the other, for the (apparently) simple purpose of laying
down his cigar, upon his extreme left, or if he were not
smoking he might lean over in the same manner to 'monkey
with his chips' (<i>i.e.</i> to arrange his counters). In
this position the orifice of the pocket would come level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with the front end of the pack, the latter being completely
covered by his right arm. This would give him
an opportunity of pushing the three selected cards into
the pocket, where they would remain until he had dealt
out all the cards and given off all the 'draft' except his
own. Still holding the pack in his left hand, and his
hand in front of him, he would again cross his right hand
over, this time for the purpose of taking up and examining
his own hand of cards, which he had taken the precaution
of dealing well to the left, to give him an excuse
for crossing his hands. He would then remove the
cards from the cuff-pocket to the top of the pack, and
lay the whole down upon the table. His manœuvring
having been successful so far, he would now throw away
three indifferent cards from his hand and deliberately help
himself to the three top cards of the pack. These, of course,
would be the three (aces for preference) which he had
previously had concealed in the pocket. Thus, he is
bound to have a 'full,' in any case. If he had been so
fortunate as to possess another ace among the cards
which fell to his hand on the deal, he would have a
'four'; which can only be beaten when 'straights' are
played by a 'straight flush'—in other words, a sequence
of five cards, all of the same suit. His chances of
'winning the pot,' then, are infinite as compared with
those of the other players.</p>

<p>The great disadvantage of the cuff-pocket was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
difficulty of removing the cards when once they had
been put into it. To facilitate their removal, therefore,
the pocket was sometimes provided with a slide, having
a projecting stud, which could be drawn with the finger.
This would throw the cards out into the hand.</p>

<p>This description will serve to enlighten the reader as
to the advantages to be gained by substituting the cuff-holdout
in place of the pocket which it is intended to
supplant. It fulfils its purpose in a much more perfect
manner, being far easier to use, and requiring less skill
on the part of the operator.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 218px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_108.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="230"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 26.</span>
</div>

<p>Referring to fig. 26, it will be seen that this instrument
consists practically of a pair of jaws, which, being
movable, will separate sufficiently to allow a card to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
held between them. These jaws are drawn towards
each other by means of an elastic band slipped over
them. Elastic is the material commonly used in the
springs of holdouts, being readily replaced when worn
out or otherwise deteriorated. The projecting lever
situated at the side of the machine is for the purpose of
separating the jaws when the cards are to be withdrawn.
The act of pressing it to one
side releases the cards, and at
the same time throws up a little
arm from the body of the holdout,
which thrusts them out.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 183px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_109.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="307"><br>
  <div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span> Showing card
  held under the arm.</div>
</div>

<p>The machine is strapped
around the fore-arm with the
jaws underneath, and is worn
inside the sleeve of the coat or,
if playing in shirt-sleeves, inside
the shirt-sleeve. Acting from
the inside it will hold a card or
cards against the under surface
of the sleeve, in which position they are concealed from
view by the arm. The hands being crossed, as in the
case of the cuff-pocket, the cards are simply slipped
between the jaws, where they are held until required.
The hands being crossed for the second time, the lever
is pressed and the cards fall upon the top of the pack,
which is held underneath at the moment. This operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
is termed technically 'topping the deck.' Fig. 27 shows
the manner in which the cards are held by this machine.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 228px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_110.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="216"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—Ring Holdout.</div>
</div>

<p>An extremely simple form of appliance, and one
which may be utilised with effect, is that known as the
'ring holdout.' It is merely a small piece of watchspring
fitted
with a clip,
enabling it to
be attached
to an ordinary
finger-ring.
Between this
spring and
palm of the
hand the
cards are
held (fig. 28).</p>

<p>With a
little practice
the deck may be topped, hands made up or shifted, and
cards held out in a manner which is far safer and better
than any 'palming,' however skilfully it may be done.
Needless to say, the cards used must not be too large,
or the operator's hand too small, if this device is to be
employed.</p>

<p>We now come to the subject of coat and vest
machines, among which are to be found some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
finest examples of mechanical genius as applied to the
art of cheating.</p>

<p>The earliest vest machine was a clumsy utensil covering
nearly the whole of the wearer's chest. It was
called—not inaptly—by the gambling fraternity of the
time the 'Breast-plate.'</p>

<p>Like all other ideas, however, which contain the
germ of a great principle, this conception has been
improved upon, until it has developed into an invention
worthy of the noble end which it is intended to fulfil.</p>

<p>In its latest and most improved form, as widely used
at the present day, it is illustrated in fig. 29.</p>

<p>As a thorough acquaintance with the construction
and working of this machine will be of great assistance
to us in arriving at an understanding of those which
follow, we will go into it somewhat exhaustively with the

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 29.</span>
</div>

<p>Referring then to fig 29, <i>a</i> is a slide which is free to
move in the direction of the length of the base-plate <i>b</i>.
It is held in position and guided by means of fittings
which pass through the slot cut in the base-plate. This
slide is composed of two thin plates of metal between
which the cards are held as shown, and is protected by
the cover <i>c</i>, which is removable, and which is hinged
when in use to lugs provided for the purpose upon the
base-plate. The ends of base-plate and cover farthest
from the hinge-joint are each pierced with a row of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
small holes. These are to facilitate the sewing of the
apparatus to the divided edges of a seam.</p>

<p>Attached to the upper surface of the slide will be
seen thin strips of metal, bent into somewhat of the
form of a bow. In practice these are covered with
cloth, to prevent the noise they would otherwise make in
rubbing against the cover. As the slide moves forward
into the position it occupies in the figure these projecting
strips, pressing against the cover, tend to thrust base-plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and cover apart. This action separates the edges
of the seam to which those parts of the apparatus are
respectively sewn, and provides an aperture for the
entrance or the exit of the slide, together with the cards
it is holding out. As the slide returns to the other end
of the base-plate, the cloth-covered strips fall within the
curvature of the cover, thus allowing the edges of the
seam to come together; and when the slide is right
home, the central projecting strip passes beyond the
hinge-joint, thus tending to press the free ends of base-plate
and cover into intimate contact. The opening
which has been fabricated in the seam is thus securely
closed, and nothing amiss can be seen.</p>

<p>The to-and-fro movement of the slide is effected in
the following manner. Attached at one end to the base-plate
is a flexible tube <i>d</i>, consisting simply of a helix of
wire closely coiled. Through this tube passes a cord <i>e</i>,
one end of which is led around pulleys below the base-plate,
and attached to the slide in such a manner that,
when the cord is pulled, the slide is drawn into the
position shown. To the other end of the cord is fastened
a hook for the purpose of attaching it to the 'tab' or
loop at the back of the operator's boot. It may be here
mentioned that the cord used in this and all similar
machines is a very good quality of fishing-line. The
slide is constantly drawn towards its normal position
within the machine by the piece of elastic <i>f</i>. The band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<i>g</i> with the buckle attached is intended to support the
machine within the coat or vest.</p>

<p>The foregoing description necessarily partakes of the
nature of Patent Office literature, but it is hoped that
the reader will be enabled to digest it, and thereby form
some idea of this interesting invention.</p>

<p>Although it is both a coat and vest machine, this
apparatus is more convenient to use when fastened
inside the coat, as the front edges of that garment are
readier to hand than those of the waistcoat. The edge
of the right breast is unpicked, and the machine is sewn
into the gap. The flexible tube is passed down the left
trouser-leg, inside which the hook hangs at the end of
the cord ready for attachment to the boot.</p>

<p>When the operator is seated at the table, he seizes a
favourable opportunity of hooking the cord to the loop
of his boot, and all is ready. Having obtained possession
of the cards he wishes to hold out, he holds them
flat in his hand, against his breast. Then, by merely
stretching his leg, the cord is pulled, the seam of the
coat opens (the aperture being covered, however, by his
arm) and out comes the end of the slide. The cards are
quietly inserted into the slide; the leg is drawn up, and—hey,
presto! the cards have disappeared. When they
are again required, another movement of the leg will
bring them into the operator's hand.</p>

<p>One can readily see how useful a device of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
would be in a game of the 'Nap' order. Having
abstracted a good hand from the pack (five cards 'never
would be missed') it could be retained in the holdout as
long as might be necessary. Upon finding oneself possessed
of a bad hand, the concealed cards could be
brought out, and the others hidden until it came to one's
turn to deal, and then they could be just thrown out on
to the pack.</p>

<p>The price of this little piece of apparatus is $25.00,
and, doubtless, it is worth the odd five, being well made
and finished up to look pretty. In fact, it is quite a
mantelboard ornament, as most of these things are.
Evidently, the sharp, whilst possessing the crafty and
thieving instincts of the magpie, has also the magpie's
predilection for things which are bright and attractive.
Therefore his implements are made resplendent with
nickel and similar precious metals. Although electroplating
or something of the kind is necessary to prevent
rust and corrosion, one would be inclined to think that
articles which are intended to escape observation would
be better adapted to their end if they were protected by
some method just a trifle less obtrusive in its brilliancy.
However, that is not our business. If the buyers are
satisfied, what cause have <i>we</i> to complain?</p>

<p>The 'Kepplinger' vest or coat machine, which is
referred to in the Catalogue (p. 293), is exactly the same
thing as that just described, with the addition of Kepplinger's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
method of pulling the string, which will be
described further on.</p>

<p>The 'Arm Pressure' vest machine, mentioned in the
same Catalogue, is a modification of the old 'Jacob's
Ladder' sleeve holdout, to which we shall have occasion
to revert presently. In an earlier edition of the Catalogue
the arm-pressure machine is thus eulogised:—</p>

<p>'New Vest Machine. Guaranteed to be the best
Vest Machine made. This machine weighs about three
ounces, and is used half-way down the vest, where it
comes natural to hold your hands and cards. The work
is done with one hand and the lower part of the same
arm. You press against a small lever with the arm (an
easy pressure of three-quarters of an inch throws out the
cards back of a few others held in your left hand), and
you can reach over to your checks or do anything else
with your right hand while working the Hold-Out. The
motions are all natural and do not cause suspicion. The
machine is held in place by a web belt; you don't have
to sew anything fast, but when you get ready to play you
can put on the machine and when through can remove
it in half a minute. There are no plates, and no strings
to pull on, and no springs that are liable to break or get
out of order. This machine is worth fifty of the old
style Vest Plates for practical use, and you will say the
same after seeing one.'</p>

<p>The statement guaranteeing this to be the best vest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
machine ever made has been expunged of late, as will
be noticed in the reproduction of the Catalogue upon
page 294. In reality it is not nearly so efficient as the
Kepplinger, all statements and opinions to the contrary
notwithstanding. Its construction will be readily understood
from the description of the 'Jacob's Ladder'
which follows next in order.</p>

<p>This brings us, then, to the subject of sleeve machines,
or appliances whereby the sharp, like Ah Sin,
the 'Heathen Chinee,' who understood so well 'the
game he did not understand,' is enabled to have a few
cards up his sleeve. 'Up his sleeve!' How those
words suggest the explanation so often given by the
innocent-minded public to account for the disappearance
of the various articles which slip so nimbly through
a conjurer's fingers. And yet, if they only knew it, that
is about the last place in the world that a conjurer, as a
rule, would use as a receptacle for anything. Of course
there is no Act of Parliament to prevent him, should he
desire to do so; but that's another story. With the
sharp, however, there are several Acts of Parliament to
prevent <i>him</i> from using his sleeve for any such purpose;
and yet he often resorts to it. How true is the saying
that 'one man may steal a horse, whilst another may
not look over the hedge.'</p>

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 31.</span>
</div>

<p>As far as can be ascertained, the 'Jacob's Ladder'
was the forerunner of all other sleeve holdouts. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
fastened to the under side of the fore-arm, and worked by
pressure upon the table. Its construction was essentially
that of a pair of lazy-tongs, arranged as in figs. 30 and 31.
The base-plate carrying the working parts was curved so as
to lie closely against the arm and hold the machine steady
whilst in use. The 'lazy-tongs' device was fixed to the
base-plate at one end, the other being free to move, and
carrying the clip for the cards. Situated at an angle above
the 'tongs' was a lever, also attached at one end to the
base-plate, the other end terminating in a knob. Half-way
down this lever was hinged a connecting-rod, joining
the lever with the second joint of the 'tongs.' Pressure
being applied to the knob, the connecting-rod would force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
out the joint to which it was attached; and the motion
being multiplied by each successive joint, the clip was
caused to protrude beyond the coat cuff. In this position
the card could be inserted or removed as in the cases
already noticed. The clip was returned to its place
within the sleeve by means of a rubber band.</p>

<p>Some of these 'Jacob's Ladder' sleeve machines are
made to work by pulling a string, after the manner of
the coat and vest machine already described. Those
advertised at $50.00 are of this description.</p>

<p>The advantage of a machine of this kind is of course
found in the fact that the cards are brought directly into
the hand. This particular form, however, was very difficult
to use, as the cards were always liable to catch in
the cuff, a circumstance which is obviously much to the
detriment of the apparatus. There is also the further
disadvantage of being compelled to wear an abnormally
large shirt-cuff, which in itself would attract attention
among men who had their wits about them.</p>

<p>The enormous facilities for unostentatious operation
afforded by a machine working inside the sleeve were too
readily apparent to allow of the sleeve holdout falling
into disuse. It was the kind of thing which must inevitably
be improved upon, until it became of practical
utility. And such has been the case. The very finest
holdout the world has ever seen is that known as the
Kepplinger or San Francisco. This machine in its latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
forms is certainly a masterpiece. Yet so little appreciation
has the world for true genius, that the inventor of
this marvellous piece of apparatus is practically unknown
to the vast majority of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>Kepplinger was a professional gambler; that is what
<i>he</i> was. In other words, he was a sharp—and of the
sharpest.</p>

<p>As to the date at which this bright particular Star of
the West first dawned upon the horizon of 'Tom Tiddler's
Ground' deponent sayeth not. Neither have we any substantial
record of the facts connected with the conception
and elaboration of that great idea with which his name
is associated. Of its introduction into the field of practical
utility, however, and its subsequent revelation to the
fraternity to whom its existence was of the utmost consequence,
the details are available, and therefore may be
revealed. The event occurred in this wise, as follows,
that is to say:—</p>

<p>In the year of grace 1888, Kepplinger, the inventor,
gambler and cheat, was resident and pursuing his daily
avocations in the city known colloquially as 'Frisco.'</p>

<p>Now it is a singular feature of human nature that, whatever
a man's calling may be, however arduous or exacting,
he becomes in course of time so much a creature of habit
that he is never really happy apart from it. One may
suppose that it is the consciousness of ability to do certain
things, and to do them well, which accounts for this fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
At any rate, the fact remains. We are all alike in this
respect—especially some of us. The barrister at leisure
will prefer to sit in Court and watch another conducting
a case; the actor with an evening to spare will go and
see someone else act; the omnibus-driver with a day off
will perch himself upon a friend's vehicle, and ride to
and fro; and the sharp will infallibly spend his leisure
moments in gambling. When there are no dupes to be
plundered, no 'pigeons' who have a feather left to fly with,
the 'rooks' will congregate in some sequestered spot,
and enjoy a quiet game all to themselves. And they play
fairly? Yes—if they are obliged to do so; not otherwise.
They will cheat each other if they can. Honour amongst
thieves! Nonsense.</p>

<p>In 1888, then, Kepplinger's relaxation for some
months consisted of a 'hard game' with players who
were all professional sharps like himself. The circle was
composed entirely of men who thought they 'knew the
ropes' as well as he did. In that, however, they were
considerably in error. He was acquainted with a trick
worth any two which they could have mentioned.
However much the fortunes of the others might vary,
Kepplinger never sustained a loss. On the contrary, he
always won. The hands he held were enough to turn
any gambler green with envy, and yet, no one could
detect him in cheating. His companions were, of course,
all perfectly familiar with the appliances of their craft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Holdouts in a game of that description would have been,
one would think, useless incumbrances. The players
were all too well acquainted with the signs and tokens
accompanying such devices, and Kepplinger gave no sign
of the employment of anything of the kind. He sat like
a statue at the table, he kept his cards right away from
him, he did not move a muscle as far as could be seen;
his opponents could look up his sleeve almost to the
elbow, and yet <i>he won</i>.</p>

<p>This being the condition of affairs, it was one which
could not by any stretch of courtesy be considered
satisfactory to anyone but Kepplinger himself. Having
borne with the untoward circumstances as long as their
curiosity and cupidity would allow them, his associates
at length resolved upon concerted action. Arranging
their plan of attack, they arrived once again at the
rendezvous, and commenced the game as usual. Then,
suddenly and without a moment's warning, Kepplinger
was seized, gagged, and held hard and fast.</p>

<p>Then the investigation commenced. The great
master-cheat was searched, and upon him was discovered
the most ingenious holdout ever devised.</p>

<p>What did the conspirators do then? Did they 'lay
into him' with cudgels, or 'get the drop' on him with
'six-shooters'? Did they, for instance, hand him over to
the Police? No! ten thousand times no! They did
none of those things, nor had they ever any intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of doing anything of the kind. Being only human—and
sharps—they did what they considered would serve their
own interests best. A compact was entered into, whereby
Kepplinger agreed to make a similar instrument to
the one he was wearing for each of his captors, and once
again the temporary and short-lived discord gave place
to harmony and content.</p>

<p>Had Kepplinger been content to use less frequently
the enormous advantage he possessed, and to have
exercised more discretion in winning, appearing to lose
sometimes, his device might have been still undiscovered.</p>

<p>It was thus, then, that the secret leaked out, and
probably without the occurrence of this 'little rift within
the lute'—or should it be <i>loot</i>?—the reader might not
have had this opportunity of inspecting the details of the
'Kepplinger' or 'San Francisco' holdout.</p>

<p>This form of sleeve machine will be easily understood
by the reader who has followed the description of the
coat and vest holdout already given upon referring to
fig. 32 upon the opposite page, the illustration being a
diagrammatic representation of the various parts of the
apparatus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_124.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="289"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 32.</span>
</div>

<p>It is evident that we are here brought into contact
with a greater complexity of strings, wheels, joints, tubes,
pulleys, and working parts generally than it has hitherto
been our lot to encounter. There is, however, nothing
which is superfluous among all these things. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
detail of the apparatus is absolutely necessary to secure
its efficiency. The holdout itself, <i>a</i>, is similar in construction
to the coat and vest machine, except that it
is longer, and that the slide <i>b</i> has a greater range of
movement.</p>

<p>The machine is worn with a special shirt, having a
double sleeve and a false cuff. This latter is to obviate
the necessity of having 'a clean boiled shirt,' and the
consequent trouble of fixing the machine to it, more
frequently than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the free ends of the base-plate
and cover, instead of being pierced with holes, as in the
vest machine, are serrated, forming a termination of sharp
points (<i>p</i>). These are for the purpose of facilitating the
adaptation of the machine to the operator's shirt-sleeve,
which is accomplished in the following manner. In the
wristband of the inner sleeve a series of little slits is
cut with a penknife, and through these slits the points
upon the base-plate are thrust. The base-plate itself is
then sewn to the sleeve with a few stitches, one or two
holes being made in the plate to allow this to be done
readily. Thus the points are prevented from being
accidentally withdrawn from the slits, and the whole
apparatus is firmly secured to the sleeve. In the lower
edge of the false cuff slits are cut in a similar manner,
and into these the points of the cover are pushed. The
cuff is held securely to the cover by means of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
strings, which are tied to holes provided for the purpose
in the sides of the cover. These arrangements having
been made, the shirt, with the machine attached, is ready
to be worn. The operator having put it on, takes a
shirt stud with rather a long stem, and links the inner
sleeve round his wrist. Then he fastens the false cuff to
the inner sleeve by buttoning the two lower stud-holes
over the stud already at his wrist. Thus, the inner
sleeve and the cuff are held in close contact by the
base-plate and cover of the machine. Finally, he fastens
the outer sleeve over the whole, by buttoning it over the
long stud which already holds the inner sleeve and the
cuff. Thus, the machine is concealed between the two
sleeves. If one were able to look inside the operator's
cuff whilst the machine is in action, it would appear as
though the wristband and cuff came apart, and the cards
were protruded through the opening. The points, then,
are the means whereby the double sleeve is held open
while the machine is in operation, and closed when it is
at rest.</p>

<p>From the holdout, the cord which works the slide
is led to the elbow-joint, where it passes around a pulley
(<i>c</i>). This joint, like all the others through which the
cord has to pass, is what is known as 'universal'; that
is to say, it allows of movement in any direction. From
the elbow to the shoulder the cord passes through an
adjustable tube (<i>d</i>). The telescopic arrangement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the tube is to adapt it to the various lengths of arm in
different operators. At the shoulder-joint (<i>e</i>) is another
universal pulley-wheel, which is fastened up to the
shoulder by a band of webbing or any other convenient
means. At this point begins the flexible tube of coiled
wire, which enables the cord to adapt itself to every
movement of the wearer, and yet to work without
much friction (<i>f</i>). The flexible tube terminates at the
knee in a third pulley (<i>g</i>), attached to the leg by a garter
of webbing. The cord (<i>h</i>) now passes through an opening
in the seam of the trouser-leg and across to the
opposite knee, where through a similar opening projects
a hook (<i>i</i>), over which the loop at the end of the cord is
placed.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the sharp walks about
with his knees tethered together with a piece of string,
and a hook sticking out from one leg; or even that he
would be at ease with the knowledge of having a seam
on each side unpicked for a distance of two inches or
so. That would be what he might call 'a bit too thick.'
No; when the sharp sits down to the table, nothing of
any such a nature is visible. Nor when he rises from
the game should we be able to discover anything
wrong with his apparel. He is much too knowing for
that. The arrangement he adopts is the following:—</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 247px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_128.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="155"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>—Seam-clips, A and B.</div>
</div>

<p>At each knee of the trousers, where the seams are
split open, the gap thus produced is rendered secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
again, and free from observation, by means of the little
spring-clip shown in fig. 33. This contrivance is sewn
into the seam, being perforated to facilitate that
operation. When closed, it keeps the edges of the
opening so well together that one could never suspect
the seam of having been tampered with. When it is
required to open the gap, the ends of the clip are
pressed with the finger and thumb (B, fig 33). This
instantly produces a lozenge-shaped opening in the
seam, and allows of the connection between the knees
being made.</p>

<p>When the sharp sits down to play, then, he first
presses open these clips; next, he draws out the cord,
which has hitherto lain concealed within the trouser-leg,
and brings into position the hook, which, turning upon a
pivot, has until now rested flat against his leg: lastly, he
passes the loop at the end of the cord over the hook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and all is in readiness. These operations require far
less time to accomplish than to describe.</p>

<p>The sharp being thus harnessed for the fray, it
becomes apparent that by slightly spreading the knees,
the string is tightened, and by this means the slide
within the body of the holdout is thrust out, through the
cuff, into his hand. The cards which he desires to hold
out being slightly bent, so as to adapt themselves to the
curve of the cuff, and placed in the slide, the knees are
brought together, and the cards are drawn up into the
machine.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the game the cord is unhooked,
and tucked back through the seam; the hook is turned
round, so that it lies flat; and finally the apertures are
closed by pressing the sides of the clips together.</p>

<p>There is one point in connection with the practical
working of the machine which it may be as well to
mention. The pulley <i>g</i> at the end of the flexible
tube is not fixed to the knee permanently, or the
sharp would be unable to stand up straight, with the
tube only of the requisite length; and if it were made
long enough to reach from knee to shoulder whilst he
was in a standing position, there would be a good deal
too much slack when he came to sit down. This pulley,
therefore, is detachable from the band of webbing, and
is fixed to it when required by means of a socket into
which it fits with a spring-catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Such then, is the Kepplinger holdout; and the
selling-price of the apparatus complete is $100.00. If
there were any inventor's rights in connection with this
class of machinery, doubtless the amount charged would
be very much higher. Governments as a rule, however,
do not recognise any rights whatever as appertaining to
devices for use in the unjust appropriation of other
people's goods or money—at least, not when such devices
are employed by an individual. In the case of devices
which form part of the machinery of government, the
Official Conscience is, perhaps, less open to the charge of
prejudice and narrow-mindedness. What is sauce for
the (individual) goose is not sauce for the (collective)
gander. However, two wrongs would not make a right,
and perhaps all is for the best.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of holdouts, there is one
other form to which it is necessary to refer, viz. the
table holdout. It is thus described by the maker:—</p>

<p>'<i>Table Holdout.</i>—Very small and light. It can be put
under and removed from any table in less than half a
minute. Works easily from either knee. It will bring
three or more cards up into your hand and take back the
discards as you hold your hands and cards in a natural
position on top of the table.'</p>

<p>This 'contraption' is an extremely simple thing, its
recommendation being that it accomplishes mechanically
what the 'bug' requires manipulation to effect. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
constructed on the same principle as the ordinary vest
machine, and is fastened to the under side of the table-top
by means of a spike, in a similar manner to the
table reflector. The string which works the slide terminates,
at the end which is pulled, in a hook having a
sharp point. The machine being fixed under the table
ready to commence operations, the pointed hook is thrust
through the material of the trousers just above one knee.
When the slide is required to come forward, the knee
is dropped a little; and, upon raising the knee again,
the slide is withdrawn by its spring, as in all similar
arrangements.</p>

<p>By this time the reader will be in a position to understand
the nature of the 'reflector on machine,' referred to
in the last chapter, without needing to be wearied with
further details of this particular kind.</p>

<p>Having thus glanced at all the principal varieties
of the modern holdout, with one or two of the more
ancient ones, it only remains to add a few general
remarks to what has been said.</p>

<p>Each class of machine has its own peculiar advantages
and disadvantages. Each sharp has his own peculiarities
of taste and his own methods of working. Therefore,
there is no one kind of appliance which appeals equally
to all individuals. Some will prefer one machine; some
another. That, of course, is the rule in the world
generally. A great deal also depends upon the manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and customs of the country in which the machine is to
be used.</p>

England who hold their cards in the manner represented in
fig. 34? Very few, I take it. Yet it is a very good
method of preventing others from seeing one's hand.
Further, it is the correct way to hold the cards when using
the Kepplinger sleeve-machine. The cards are placed
flat in one hand, the fingers of the other are pressed
upon them in the centre, whilst the thumb turns up one
corner to allow of the indices being read. To adopt
this method in England, however, would be to arouse
suspicion at once, merely because it is unusual. Therefore
the vest machine is the best for the English sharp;
although no holdout can compare with the Kepplinger
in a game of Poker in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Although most of these contrivances are simple in
operation, the reader must not run away with the idea
that their use entails no skill upon the part of the sharp
who uses them. That would be far too blissful a state of
affairs ever to be achieved in this weary world, where all
is vanity and vexation of spirit. Certainly, they do not
demand the dismal hours of solitary confinement with
hard labour which have to be spent upon some of the
manipulative devices and sleight-of-hand dodges; but
still they require a certain amount of deftness, which
can only be acquired by practice. The following instructions
will represent the advice of an expert, given to
a novice who proposed to try his hand with a machine at
the game of Poker:—</p>

<p>'Practise at least three weeks or a month with the
machine, to get it down fine [i.e. to gain facility of
working, both of machine and operator]. Don't work
the machine too much. [Not too often during the game.]
In a big game [that is, where the stakes are high] three
or four times in a night are enough. <span class="smcap">Never</span> play it in a
small game [because the amount that could be won
would be incommensurate with the risk of detection].
Holding out one card will beat any square game [honest
play] in the world. Two cards is very strong; but can
easily be played on smart people. Three cards is too
much to hold out on smart men, as a 'full' is too big
to be held often without acting as an eye-opener.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Never, under any circumstances, hold out four or five.
One card is enough, as you are really playing six cards
to everyone else's five. This card will make a 'straight'
of a 'flush' sometimes; or, very often, will give you
'two pair' or 'three' of a kind. If you are very expert,
you can play the machine on your own deal; but it
looks better to do it on someone else's.'</p>

<p>Having digested these words of comfort and advice—precious
jewels extracted from the crown of wisdom and
experience—we may proceed on our way invigorated
and refreshed by the consciousness of having acquired
knowledge such as rarely falls to the lot of man to possess.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>MANIPULATION</i></span></h2>

<p>Many readers upon the occasion of their taking up this
book for the first time will be under the impression,
doubtless, that the most important revelations it contains
will prove to be those connected with the manipulative
devices employed by card-sharpers and others in
cheating the simple-minded and unwary. But, whatever
preconceptions upon the subject may have existed, the
details of mere manipulation are far from being those of
the most consequence to the sharp in the exercise of
his profession. This, of course, must be understood to
be simply a general statement which does not apply to
particular cases. The low-class English sharp, for
instance, relies almost entirely upon certain forms of
sleight of hand to deceive the senses of his dupes.
Again, there are some tricks and dodges which are
practised by even the most high-class cheats. The rule
is, however, that mere sleight of hand is to a great extent
obsolete; at least, among those who seek to swindle
really good card-players. The methods of legerdemain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
are more the common property of the multitude than
formerly, and this fact tends to operate very largely to
the detriment of the sharp. With the legitimate <i>prestidigitateur</i>
it is otherwise. It is true, some persons are
in a position to form a better idea as to how his tricks
are accomplished than was the case in years gone by;
but even then, there remains the advantage that they
are better able to appreciate his deftness and his ingenuity.
Therefore, he is rather benefited than otherwise
by the spread of this particular form of knowledge.
It is the poor sharp who has suffered through the
enlightenment of the public. His lines have fallen in
rough places of late years; yet it can hardly be said
that he has not proved himself more than equal to the
occasion. When checkmated in one direction, he is
generally capable of creating a diversion in his own
favour in another.</p>

<p>In card games especially there is always a risk in
resorting to manipulation nowadays. There is the ever-present
possibility of some one among the cheat's antagonists
having sufficient knowledge to detect him in
his manipulation of the cards. He is haunted by the
fear that sharp eyes are watching his every movement,
and he knows full well that he can accomplish nothing
in this way without some movement which a trained eye
would instantly detect. Once detected in cheating, his
reputation is gone. He can no longer hope to find dupes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
among his former acquaintances. He must seek 'fresh
fields and pastures new.' However precious reputation
may be to an honest man, it is a thousand times more
so to the sharp. Once his reputation is gone he has to
depend upon chance custom; whereas he might otherwise
have a nice little circle of regular clients, at whose
expense he could live in ease and comfort.</p>

<p>As a professional sharp remarked to a young friend,
to whom he was giving lessons in the art of cheating:
'The best gamblers [they don't call themselves sharps]
play with fair cards only; and, by being wonderfully keen
card-players, make their brains win, instead of cheating
with the pack. They play in partnership (secret), and
are invincible, as they know all the various swindles and
so can protect themselves from being cheated. The most
successful men are among this class, although nearly all
of them can do the finest work with a pack of cards.</p>

<p>'The next best class are those who play marked
cards well, many of them using cards that no one not
acquainted with the work could find out in a lifetime.
[Instance, the scroll-work on p. 51.] These men, if they
can only get their own cards into a game, are sure to
win.</p>

<p>'Then, after these, come the class of "second dealers,"
"bottom dealers," and men who habitually do work with
the pack to win. <i>These men always get caught in the long
run.</i>'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Such, then, being the case as evidenced by the word
of an expert, one may form some idea of the relative
value of manipulation as compared with other methods
in the hands of the card-sharper.</p>

<p>To deal thoroughly with this branch of our subject
would require a text-book of sleight of hand, as nearly all
the tricks of 'hanky-panky' could be made to serve the
purposes of cheating. But since so many excellent
treatises of that kind are readily accessible to the public,
it would be superfluous to do more than give the reader
a general idea of those methods which the sharp has
made peculiarly his own. Even among those which are
here represented, there are many devices which are
rapidly becoming obsolete, and others of which it is very
doubtful how far they are used at the present moment.
In sharping, like everything else, 'the old order changeth,
giving place to new.' However, the reader must judge
for himself as to what devices would be likely to deceive
him personally, and that will help him to an understanding
of what would probably have the same effect upon
others. Thus he will be able to arrive at a tolerably
approximate estimate of the probabilities in connection
with the use or disuse of any individual trick. The
author, being too old a bird to be caught with any such
chaff, is really not so competent to form an opinion upon
the subject. In his case familiarity, if it has not bred
contempt, has at least deadened the due appreciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the relative merits and advantages of the various trickeries.
They all appear of the same tint against the background
of past experience, each one possessing but little
individuality of its own. With the reader, however, it is
in all probability different. Assuming that he has merely
a casual acquaintance with manual dexterity of this kind
he will come fresh to the subject, and therefore to him
the details will assume their proper relative proportions.</p>

<p>To begin, then, with the oldest and most simple
manipulations, our first topic is that of the 'Bottom
Deal.' This trick, simple as it is, is the very stronghold
of the common English sharp. In whatever game he is
playing, he seizes the opportunity afforded by picking
up the cards preparatory to dealing to place certain cards
which would form a good hand at the bottom of the
pack, and in shuffling he takes good care not to disturb
them. But there is still the 'cut' to be thought about.
Well, we shall see later on how the effects of the cut are
to be obviated. In the meantime, however, it is evident
that if the cards were cut and piled in the ordinary
manner, those cards which the sharp had so carefully
preserved at the bottom would be brought to the centre.
That would never answer his purpose; so, when the cut
has been made, if the game is one which does not necessitate
the dealing out of the entire pack, he simply takes up
the bottom half of the pack, leaving the other on the
table. Then, holding the cards as in fig. 35, he proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to deal. From this point the trick, as its name suggests,
consists of dealing the bottom cards, either to himself or,
preferably, to a confederate, in place of the upper cards
which should justly fall to that hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_140.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="164"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>—Bottom Deal.</div>
</div>

<p>From the position in which the cards are held it will
be seen that, as each card is dealt, the finger and thumb
of the dealer's right hand fall respectively below and
above the pack. It is, therefore, entirely optional whether
he shall take the top card with his thumb, or the bottom
one with his finger. When a card has to be dealt, then,
to himself or to his confederate, as the case may be, it is
the bottom one which is taken; to the other players the
top ones are dealt out. When quickly done, it is
impossible to see whether the card comes from the top or
the bottom, although the manner of holding and dealing
the cards would imply that the bottom deal was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
resorted to: the cards which come from the bottom,
being pulled upwards, appear to come from the top. It
can always be detected, nevertheless, by the different
sound made by a card when brought from the bottom.
There is just a slight click, which is distinctly audible, and
easily recognised. The reader should try it for himself,
and note the effect referred to. After a few minutes'
experience he would never afterwards be mistaken in
deciding as to whether a card was dealt from the top
or bottom of the pack. A sharp who uses the bottom
deal rarely employs any other form of manipulation
whatever.</p>

<p>We now pass on to the trick known as 'Dealing
Seconds.' The trick is so named because it consists of
dealing out the second card from the top instead of the
top one. It is particularly useful in connection with
marked cards, where of course the top card can be
read, and very often the second one also.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The effect in
this case is that the sharp can always retain the better
of the two top cards for himself. Suppose, then, there
are four players. The sharp, commencing to deal,
notices that the top card is a knave, whilst the second is
a three. He therefore deals the second card to the
player immediately to his left. It may then appear that
the second card now is a king; and, consequently, the
sharp deals the top card to the second hand, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
king on top. If the card which is now second in the
pack is lower than the king, the third player receives
that card; but if the second should prove to be an ace,
the king goes to the third player, and the ace to the
sharp himself. It may happen, however, that the sharp,
having dealt round to the three players in this manner,
finds that the second of the remaining cards is of more
value to him than the first. In that case, of course, he
would deal himself the second. Thus it is seen that the
sharp has really had a choice of five cards on one round
of the deal; and the larger the number of players, the
greater his choice, although he may at times have to
choose between two cards which would answer his
purpose equally well. If he is thus compelled to give
away a good card he should dispose of it where it is
likely to do him least harm, if he can contrive to do so.
Besides marked cards, there are other methods of discovering
the value of the top card and, consequently, the
advisability of dealing seconds, as we shall see presently.</p>

<p>The trick of dealing the second card is very easily
learned. Take a pack of cards in your left hand, in the
manner usually adopted in dealing, with the thumb
lying across the middle of the pack. Then with the
thumb advance the two top cards slightly to the right.
This being done, it will be found that these two cards
can be taken between the thumb and middle finger.
With the second held by the tip of the middle finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
advance the top card a little further to the right. The
cards will now be in a position frequently adopted in
dealing, the top card being sufficiently forward to be
grasped by the right finger and thumb. So far, there is
nothing unusual in the operations; but this is where
the trick comes in. If the middle finger of the hand
holding the cards is advanced, the second card, resting
upon its tip, will be advanced also; and if at the same
time the thumb is drawn back, the top card is withdrawn
with it. It is now the second card which is the more
advanced of the two, and consequently the card which
would be taken by the right hand in dealing. In fact,
the two cards can be rubbed together by the finger and
thumb, alternately advancing and receding. If the second
card is to be dealt, then it is pushed forward and the top
one is drawn back, the movement being masked by a
slight dropping of the arm towards the operator. Of
course the change in the position of the cards is not
made until the instant the right hand reaches the pack to
take the card. Thus the entire operation appears to
consist of one movement only. An expert 'second-dealer'
will place a known card on top of the pack and
deal the whole of the other cards from beneath it, leaving
that card in his hands at the finish; and this without
any manipulation being visible to any but the sharpest
vision.</p>

<p>The utility of the second-dealing method of procedure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it is evident, depends greatly upon the fact of
having a knowledge of the top card. With marked cards
the acquiring of this knowledge can present no difficulty,
and even with genuine ones the difficulty is by no means
insuperable. All that is necessary is to reach over to the
left, keeping the cards in front of one, with the top card
drawn off a little to one side, so as to have the index in
the corner visible from below, and a sly peep will do the
trick. There are innumerable excuses available to account
for the reaching over, as we have already seen in the case
of the cuff holdout. Given the fact that there is something
to the left of the operator which must be reached
with the right hand, the rest is easy. The act of leaning
to one side effectually covers the slight tilting of the left
hand which enables the under side of the cards to be seen.
There used to be an old American colonel (the numerical
strength of officers in the American army must have been
extraordinary at some time or another) at one of the best
London clubs who was very partial to the use of this
trick. He would lay his cigar upon the table, well over
to his left, and then, bending down to get it, he would
note both top and bottom cards, in the manner described.</p>

<p>Simple as this dodge may be, it is unquestionably of
great service at times. Take, for instance, the case of the
dealer at Poker. After he has dealt the cards, but before
giving off the draft, he leans over to pick up his hand,
and in so doing sees the 'size' of the top card of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
'deck.' Upon inspecting his hand, he can tell whether
the top card will be of use to him or not. If it is, he
can easily hold it back until he can take it for himself;
if not, he very generously lets someone else have it.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who may not know the game
of Poker, and in England there are many who do not, I
may illustrate the great utility of knowing the top and
bottom cards by a reference to the results attainable by
such means in the familiar game of Nap. Suppose that
you are playing a single-handed game, and it is your turn
to deal. You note the top and bottom cards. If they
happen to be decent ones, both of the same suit, you hold
back the top card, and give your opponent the second.
The top one then comes to you. You now give your opponent
the card next in order, and deal the bottom one to
yourself. The rest of the cards may be left to chance, until
the five are dealt out to each hand. The consequence of
this manœuvre is as follows. You are sure of having two
good cards of one suit, and it is about an even chance that
among the other three will be another of the same kind.
Therefore, you are pretty certain of a long suit to lead from.
Your chances, therefore, are a long way better than your
opponent's. If, however, on the other hand, you find
that the top and bottom cards are small ones, and of different
suits, you may make your opponent a present of them.
They may of course prove useful to him; but the
chances are that they do not. But, whatever happens, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
know the value of two cards out of his five; a fact which
may have considerable influence upon the result of the
hand, as all 'Nappists' will admit. Necessarily there is
nothing of real certainty about this achievement; but,
still, the player who knows the top and bottom cards, even
though he is not skilful enough to dispose of them to the
best advantage, gathers in a goodly proportion of the
chances of the game which do not belong to him by
right.</p>

<p>We now come to the consideration of methods employed
by the sharp in manipulating the cards to his
own advantage during the process of shuffling, and of preventing
the overthrow of his plans by the disarrangement
introduced into the result of his efforts in the fact of the
cards having to be cut by an opponent. However carefully
he may contrive to arrange the order of the cards,
the cut would obviously upset his calculations. Therefore,
in addition to some method of placing the cards in
order, he must also have a ready means of rendering the
cut inoperative. We have already seen how the bottom-dealer
dodges it; and now we will look into one or two
other systems, most of them equally simple, and all of
them equally effective.</p>

<p>We will suppose for the moment that the cards have
been arranged in, or at any rate not disarranged by, the
shuffle. The sharp lays the pack upon the table; his
opponent lifts up the top half and lays it down near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the bottom half. In the natural course of things the
sharp should now take up the bottom half, place it upon
the top half that was, close the cards together, and commence
to deal. If this were done, the cards which he
required to have on top would now be in the middle of
the pack, and all the trouble he had devoted to their
disposition would be wasted. So he is compelled to adopt
some means of restoring the cards to their former position.
In accomplishing this there are several courses open to
him. The simplest and most barefaced method, and yet
one which will escape detection nine times out of ten, is
the following. The cards having been cut, and the two
halves of the pack having been placed side by side in the
usual manner, the sharp picks up the bottom half with the
right hand, as though he were about to place it upon the
other; but instead of so doing, he deliberately puts it
into his left hand. Then picking up the top half, he
adds it to the other, in the position it originally occupied.
There is absolutely nothing in this but impudence, and
yet the dodge will nearly always pass muster. Try it the
next time you are playing cards, and you will find that
nobody will notice it if it is done with apparent carelessness.
Even though someone did perceive that the cards
were in the same order as formerly, the sharp could always
apologise for his inadvertence and suffer them to be cut
again.</p>

<p>Another very simple method is to cross the hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
picking up the right half of the pack with the left hand,
and the left half with the right hand. Then uncrossing
the hands, the two halves are put together in their former
order. The crossing of the hands tends to confuse
the mind of an onlooker, so that he really does not know
which hand contains the half that should be placed on
top.</p>

<p>The reader must distinctly understand that such open
and palpable deceptions as these two last would only be
practised by the very lowest class of sharps. A good man
would scorn the action.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> With regard to the methods resorted
to at any time very much depends upon the class
of sharp and the intelligence of the company in which he
happens to find himself. The employment of simple
trickeries like these in a card party of 'smart' players
could only be attended with modified success, very modified
indeed. If the players were smart, the sharp would
smart. This joke is not copyright, but it is logical
nevertheless.</p>

<p>The 'pass,' which is the essence of so many card-tricks,
is another means of restoring the order of the
cards after they have been cut. Since it is explained in
every book on conjuring, however, we will only just
glance at it. For a fuller description the reader may be referred
to Professor Hoffman's admirable treatises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
In making the pass the two halves of the pack are
picked up in the order they should rightly assume
after being cut, care being taken however that there is a
slight division maintained between them. For instance,
the bottom half is placed upon the top one as it lies upon
the table perfectly level sideways, but projecting over one
end about a quarter of an inch. The pack is now put
into the left hand, and in the act of levelling up the two
halves the little finger is inserted between them. Meanwhile
the sharp engages the other players in an animated
conversation. Then just before dealing, apparently with
the object of again levelling the cards, he covers the
pack with his right hand. In an instant the cards appear
to pass through one another, and the half which was
uppermost before cutting is in that position now. The
action is simply this. The little finger of the left hand
being between the two halves of the pack, that which is
above for the moment is held by the little finger and the
other three. The lower half is gripped by the thumb and
fingers of the right hand. Then by slightly opening the
left hand and closing the right, the two halves are drawn
asunder. Immediately reversing the motion the two
halves come together again with their respective positions
reversed. The movement necessary to effect this operation
is covered by a slight dropping of the hands at the
critical moment. This is called the 'double-handed
pass,' as both hands are used to effect it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
There are also various single-handed passes available
to the expert, but these are more difficult to accomplish
neatly, and cannot be so readily disguised. If used at all
they are accompanied by a movement of the hand from
the operator, as in pointing at something or in shaking
the wrist clear of the cuff to give freedom of arm during
dealing. The simplest of these passes is made by holding
the cards between the thumb and the last three fingers
of the left hand, a slight division between the two halves
of the pack being maintained at the thumb side. The
lower half is now dropped into the palm, and with the
forefinger it is turned up towards the thumb. The upper
half is now released and allowed to fall upon the fingers
which are extended for its reception. Finally, the lower
half is dropped upon the upper one and the original
order is restored. Much practice, of course, is required
to perform this operation with ease and despatch.</p>

<p>Another form of pass may be accomplished in putting
the cards from the right hand into the left. The pack is
held in the right hand, with the upper half slightly
advanced, and the lower nipped in the thumb-joint.
The left hand, instead of taking the whole pack, merely
takes the upper half. The right, in levelling the cards,
deposits the lower half upon the upper.</p>

<p>It must be forcibly impressed upon the reader that
under no circumstances whatever is it possible to make
the pass without that device being detected by an expert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
who is looking for it. Even half a glance at the operator's
movements would arouse suspicions which could not be
easily allayed. It is therefore a dangerous proceeding
at any time for a sharp to indulge in. It is possible
that through inattention the expert may not actually
see the pass made; but the accompanying movements
are sufficient indication of what is going on to anyone
who 'knows his way about.' In days gone by, the pass
was a power in the hands of the sharp; but now, alas,
it is only of occasional use, and the risk it involves is
very, very great.</p>

<p>Another method of dodging the cut is to take the
half of the pack which should finally be on the top, but
which the sharp desires to be underneath, holding it by
the thumb and three last fingers of the right hand,
with the forefinger bent, and its back resting upon the
back of the top card. The cards, being thus removed
from the table, are now held entirely by the forefinger
and the other three, the thumb being taken away. The
second half of the pack is now taken up between the
thumb and forefinger; at the same instant, the other
cards being slipped underneath instead of on top as they
should be. Skilfully and quickly done, this plan is very
deceptive, as such things go.</p>

<p>Rather than resort to any method of restoring the
order of the cards after they have been cut, it is far preferable
for the sharp to so arrange matters, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
that the act of cutting should bring those cards uppermost
which are required to be at the top. In a single-handed
game, by keeping strict watch upon the direction
of his opponent's gaze, he may be enabled to find an
opportunity of making the pass; but in a round game,
someone is sure to be looking at the cards, and the pass
becomes much too risky to be attempted. Therefore, in
a case of this kind, the sharp will endeavour to manipulate
the cards in such a way that the cut merely serves the
purpose of removing certain cards, which are placed above
those he needs, uppermost.</p>

  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_153.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="100"><br>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>—The Bridge.</div>
</div>

<p>The commonest plan in use for this purpose is the
device known as the 'Bridge.' This architectural contrivance
consists of either bending the two halves of the
pack in opposite directions, or bending one half, and
leaving the other straight (fig. 36). The trick derives
its name from the curvature thus produced.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> In the
illustration, the cards which are required to be on top
are the straight ones now lying underneath. An unsuspicious
player, being called upon to cut the pack, will
undoubtedly lift off the bent half, owing to the division
existing between it and the other. Then there is no need
of the pass, or anything of the kind. The sharp has
'forced the cut.' Considering how well-known the
bridge is, it is extraordinary how often it is successful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
The fact is, the players are not looking for it; they
assume that they are playing with honest men, and upon
that assumption the sharp in great measure relies.</p>

<p>The bridge is specially useful in cases where a confederate
is available to cut the cards. Then the bridge
need not be so much arched. The very slightest bend
is sufficient, as the 'confed.' will be careful to cut at
the right place. The 'end-bridge' is a variety we shall
have to touch upon later on, and other dodges for
attaining the same end as this one will be described in
the chapter on 'Prepared Cards.'</p>

<p>Working backwards, then, from the end to the means,
we arrive by a natural transition to the methods of
manipulation employed in securing an advantageous
disposition of the cards. Among these, a prominent
place is occupied by what are known as 'false shuffles.'
These are of three kinds. The first is the shuffle which
leaves undisturbed the previous arrangement of the entire
pack. The second is that which affects only part of the
pack, allowing the rest to retain its original order. The
third is the variety which effects the systematic disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of the cards in a manner which will bring good
hands to the sharp and his accomplices, if such there be,
or at any rate either to the sharp himself or to an
accomplice.</p>

<p>By way of familiarising the reader with these
processes, we will just glance through the older forms of
all three kinds. It must be distinctly borne in mind,
however, that the modern methods of shuffling have
rendered most of these obsolete. They have been
replaced by improved manipulations, as we shall see
later.</p>

<p>Of the first kind of these shuffles there is a great
variety. They are simply manipulations which appear
to be shuffles, but in reality are not so. We will
investigate one of them. The pack is taken in two
halves, one of which is held in each hand. From the
right hand half about half a dozen cards are pushed off
and placed <i>beneath</i> those in the left hand. Then, from
the left hand, three cards say are pushed off and placed
beneath those in the right hand. This process is
continued, always putting more cards from right to left
than <i>vice versa</i>, until the whole pack appears to have
been shuffled into the left hand. This looks exactly like
a genuine shuffle. In fact, most persons upon having it
explained to them will say that the cards really <i>are</i>
shuffled, but it is not so. The effect produced is that of
a simple cut. If the bridge is made before commencing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the process can be continued until the top card has
resumed its former place. Then it will be found that
there has been absolutely no disarrangement of the cards
whatever.</p>

<p>This shuffle is particularly useful at the beginning of
a game when the sharp contrives to get the deal, or upon
the introduction of a fresh pack of cards. Gamblers are
superstitious as a rule, and when their 'luck is out,'
which is generally the case when they happen to be playing
with a sharp, they will sometimes seek to improve it
by changing the cards. Now, even a new pack can be
opened for the purpose of arranging the contents, and
sealed up again so neatly that there is no evidence of its
ever having been tampered with. Then, supposing the
sharp to be a member of a club, the person who
purchases the club cards may be a confederate, and thus
the cards which are apparently fresh from the maker may
have been falsified in any desired manner.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Whatever
method may have been adopted to arrange the pack, the
foregoing shuffle will not disturb it. The cut is rendered
inefficient by either of the methods given, and all is
happiness and prosperity.</p>

<p>The second form of false shuffle is quite as easy to
accomplish as the first. All that is necessary is to take
care that the part of the pack which is required to be
kept intact should not be disturbed. The rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
cards may be shuffled to one's heart's content. The
sharp, having noted certain cards among those which
have been played that would be of service to him in
some way or another, in picking them up contrives to
place them all together at the top or bottom of the pack.
Then in shuffling he avoids all interference with those
cards. A good plan is to put the cards on top and lay
the pack upon the table. Then with the right hand lift
up the top cards, and, with the left, cut the remainder in
two and shuffle one portion into the other. This will
pass for a genuine shuffle almost anywhere. Selected
cards, placed above or below the pack, are called 'top-stock'
or 'bottom-stock,' as the case may be. They are
useful for a variety of purposes, as will be readily understood.
The effect of the holdout when used in the
game of Poker, as described in the last chapter, is to
work the top-stock for draught. The shuffle just dealt
with would work the top-stock for deal.</p>

<p>The last of the three kinds of false shuffles
enumerated is of course the most generally useful in
almost any game. Take whist for example. How
pleasant would it be to be able to deal oneself, or one's
partner, a hand containing nearly all the trumps. Well,
that is a thing which is quite possible of accomplishment
and by no means difficult. The cards are simply
arranged during the shuffle. It is what is called 'putting
up' a hand, and this is how it is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
As the tricks are played in the previous hand you
notice those which contain a preponderance of the best
cards of one suit, say diamonds. You keep an eye
particularly upon the four tricks which would make the
best hand, viz., those which contain the highest cards.
It is your turn to deal. You pick up the tricks as they
lie upon the table or are passed to you, keeping those
you require slightly separate from the rest as you gather
them up, and finally place them at the bottom of the
pack, with the little finger of your right hand inserted
between them and the cards which are above. You now
proceed to shuffle. The first operation is to put all the
cards above your little finger into the right hand. Thus
you hold the cards you require in your left hand, but
there are sixteen of them, and you only want thirteen.
Therefore you push off three of them into the right
hand. Now you are ready to make your final arrangements.
With the thumb of your left hand slip off one
card from that hand on to those in the right. Then
with the thumb of your right hand slip that card together
with the three immediately below it <i>under</i> the cards in
the left. Again you slip one from the left on top of
those in the right, and again place that card with the
three next to it under the left hand cards.</p>

<p>This action is repeated until only three cards remain
in the right hand. Arriving at this point care must be
observed. You have of course borne in mind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
necessity of having the bottom card, which will be the
trump, of the same suit as that which preponderates in the
number selected, and have arranged matters accordingly.
Now, with only three cards in the right hand, there
remain two of the selected cards above those in the left
which have not been handled. The second of these two
will be the one required for the trump card, in this case
a diamond. Therefore you put the first one on top of
the three remaining in the right, and the second one
below them. Then the whole five are put at the bottom
of the pack and the shuffle is complete. You evade the
cut by whichever method suits your opportunities best,
and upon dealing, all the selected cards fall to yourself.</p>

<p>The above is a shuffle which is easily acquired, and
when done neatly and quickly, the effect is very good. It
looks exactly like a genuine shuffle. The only difficult part
of the manipulation is placing the four cards from right to
left. There is not much time to count them. With a
little practice however, the operator can <i>feel</i> that the
right number of cards go into the other hand. The best
practice is to pick out all the cards of one suit, and
shuffle them into the others in the manner described.
Then when the cards are dealt out, it will be seen at once
whether the shuffle has been correctly performed or not.
The passing of the cards from side to side must be
quickly done, and without pausing between the movements,
if the trick is to escape detection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
This one instance will serve to give the reader the
basis of all the other shuffles in which the cards are
arranged. They all consist in the main principle of
placing certain cards all together in some convenient
position in the pack, and then arranging them with a
proper number of indifferent cards between each one and
the next. The nature of the game of course decides the
manner of their arrangement.</p>

<p>The reader may very possibly find some difficulty in
quite grasping the details of these explanations, but if he
will take a pack of cards and follow the instructions step
by step they will all become clear. If these older forms
of shuffling are thoroughly understood, it will be a great
help towards arriving at the full significance of the more
modern manipulations which are about to be described.</p>

<p>At the present day the foregoing trickeries would be
inadmissible owing to the fact that only the most juvenile
card players would ever use the form of shuffles they involve.
No <i>player</i> would ever think of taking the two
halves of the pack, one in either hand, when about to
shuffle. That style of thing is quite out of date. Indeed
in a smart game the dealer would not be even allowed
to raise the cards from the table when shuffling, although
in the ordinary way they are more often than not simply
shuffled from one hand into the other.</p>

<p>The principal shuffles of modern times are three in
number:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
1. The 'Over-hand Shuffle.'<br>
2. The 'Riffle' or 'Butt-in Shuffle.'<br>
3. The 'Écarté Shuffle.'<br>
</div>

<p>The over-hand shuffle is that in which the cards are
taken in the left hand and shuffled, a few at a time, into
the right. It is familiar to all, and requires no more than
the mere mention of it to recall it to the reader's mind.</p>

<p>The riffle, or butt-in, as it is called in America, is the
shuffle in which the pack is laid upon the table, the top
half is taken off with the right hand and laid near it.
The fingers of either hand then press upon the cards of
the respective halves of the pack, whilst the thumbs
'riffle' or bend up the corners of the cards, allowing them
to spring down, one or two at a time, from right to left
alternately, those of one side falling between those of the
other. Finally the cards are levelled up and the shuffle
is complete.</p>

<p>The écarté shuffle is one in which the cards are laid
on the table with one side of the pack facing the operator.
The top half of the pack, or rather less, is taken off
with the right hand and shuffled into the remainder of
the cards held by the left as they lie upon the table.</p>

<p>In those cases where the dealer is not allowed to
shuffle the cards in his hands, the riffle or the écarté
shuffle is used. A variety of the riffle called the French
shuffle is sometimes adopted in which a half of the pack
is taken in either hand, the two halves resting upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
table at one end and inclined towards each other, a few
cards at a time being allowed to fall from either side
alternately.</p>

<p>With these higher class shuffles then, it is evident that
more improved methods of manipulation must be adopted
to render them amenable to the purposes of cheating. We
have therefore to examine the means employed by the
sharp (1) to keep intact a pre-arrangement of the cards,
(2) to leave undisturbed a certain portion of the pack
which has been 'put up' or 'stocked,' and (3) to put up
hands or arrange the cards to suit his own purposes.
The corollary to these manipulations is necessarily the
means of nullifying the effect of the cut which follows as
an inevitable consequence upon the shuffle; except, of
course, in those cases where a player is content to 'knock'
instead of cutting. This 'knock' is an American institution,
and consists of merely rapping the top of the pack
with the knuckles. It signifies that the player does not
wish to cut, and is frequently practised by the sharp's
accomplice, when he has one, to avoid disturbing the order
of the cards.</p>

<p>To retain the original order or pre-arrangement of a
whole pack, the riffle is the shuffle that is generally
used; the modification referred to in the last paragraph
but one being the most convenient form for the purpose.
The top half of the pack being taken in the right hand,
and those of the bottom half in the left, the cards are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
riffled together upon the table. If the pack were levelled
up, the shuffle would of course be effectual; but it is in
the act of levelling that the trickery is introduced. As
the cards rest in front of the operator, those of one side
alternating with those of the other, they are covered by
his hands, the thumbs being towards him, the three
first fingers of each hand on the opposite side of the
pack, and the little fingers pressing upon the ends of
the right and left halves respectively. In this way the
cards are just straightened merely, but not closed up. A
turn of the hands, from the little fingers outwards, throws
the two packets of cards at an angle one to the other,
the thumbs now resting upon the corners nearest the
operator. The little fingers are then closed in towards
the thumbs. This has the effect of pushing the cards of
each packet diagonally across those of the other. Those
of the right half pass against the thumb of the left hand,
whilst those of the left half pass in a similar manner
across the right thumb. Thus the cards simply pass
from either hand into the other. The top half of the
pack is now held by the fingers and thumb of the <i>left</i>
hand and <i>vice versa</i>. The two packets are now quickly
separated, and that in the left hand is placed above that
in the right. The whole of the cards are therefore in
their original positions, although they appear to have
been perfectly shuffled. The passing of the cards across
is to give the appearance of closing them together;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
whereas they really pass right through into the opposite
hands. Quickly done, this shuffle is most deceptive,
but the whole operation should not occupy more than a
couple of seconds. It can always be detected by one
who knows it, on account of the necessity of turning
the two halves at an angle; otherwise it is perfect. It
cannot be very successfully performed with a full pack,
but with an écarté pack of 32 cards it is very simple.</p>

<p>To allow a certain number of cards to remain
undisturbed is a comparatively simple matter in any
shuffle. It is only necessary to see that they <i>are</i>
undisturbed. In the over-hand shuffle they may be
placed either at the top or bottom of the pack, passing
them all together from the left hand into the right.
When they are at the top, the approved method is to
slip off at once, into the right hand, as many of the
top cards as may be necessary to insure that the
whole of the selected cards are together. This packet
is held by pressing the cards endwise between the
forefinger and the root of the thumb. The remaining
cards are then shuffled <i>on to the forefinger</i>, thus maintaining
a slight division above those which have been
put up. The final movement of the shuffle is to part
the pack at this division, and return the top cards to
their original position.</p>

<p>In the riffle shuffle it is quite as easy to retain the
position of any cards which may require to be kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
view. If they are at the bottom of the pack, they are
simply riffled down upon the table before any others
are allowed to fall, and the rest of the cards are shuffled
above them. If they are at the top, they are held back
until all the other cards have fallen. In either case, the
cards of one half are simply let down sooner or more
slowly than those of the other, according to whether
the stocked cards are at the top or the bottom.</p>

<p>In the écarté shuffle, the proceedings are a little more
complex. It would never do to coolly ignore a certain
portion of the pack in shuffling; therefore the observers
have to be thrown off the scent. This is done by means
of the manipulation known as 'the French card-sharper's
shuffle,' which is accomplished in the following manner.
The pack lies upon the table before the operator, with
the stocked cards on top. With the thumb and <i>second</i>
finger of the right hand, he seizes a sufficient number of
the top cards to be sure of having the selected ones all
together, and lifts them up, at the same time moving
his hand away from him so as to leave the pack unobstructed
by the cards just raised. Then with the thumb
and <i>first</i> finger of the left hand, he takes up a similar
packet of cards from the pack, leaving probably about a
third of the pack still remaining on the table. Now
comes the trick. The right hand packet is placed under
the cards just raised by the left thumb and forefinger,
and is immediately gripped by the <i>middle</i> finger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
thumb of that hand. Meanwhile, the left-hand packet
is taken by the right thumb and forefinger, and moved
aside. The two packets have thus changed hands, the
top cards being now in the left. In this position they
are held by the left finger and thumb, whilst the right
hand shuffles the second packet into the cards remaining
on the table. This process is gone through several times
and the cards appear to be thoroughly well shuffled.
Nevertheless, it is evident that the top cards have
remained intact throughout.</p>

<p>Before passing on to the third form of false shuffle, by
means of which cards are put up or stocked, it is necessary
at this point to refer to the device known as the
'end-bridge,' a thing which is commonly used at the
present time to force the cut at a given point in the
pack. Any false shuffle is manifestly useless without
some resource of this kind. As the reader is doubtless
aware, it is a common practice among card players, at
the conclusion of the shuffle and before giving the pack
to be cut, to part it at about the middle and place the
lower half above the upper. This seems to have become
quite the orthodox termination of any shuffle; just a
final cut as it were to finish. It is in this final cut that
the end-bridge is generally made. We will suppose that
the stocked cards are at the top of the pack. The top
half is taken by the thumb and second finger of the right
hand and drawn off; the cards being held near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
corners at one end, the forefinger meanwhile resting
upon them between the second finger and thumb. In
the act of drawing off the cards they are pressed between
the thumb and finger, so as to bend them slightly concave
at the back between the corners by which they are held.
The bottom half of the pack is then placed above the
upper one, the curvature of which produces a slight
division between the two halves at one end. The other
end not having been tampered with it can be turned
towards the players with impunity. The cards being
levelled, they are laid on the table in such a position
that the player who is to cut will take them by the ends;
and it is almost certain that he will cut at the bridge.</p>

<p>By way of example, then, the French card-sharper's
shuffle in its entirety would consist of the following
movements. (1) The top cards are lifted by the right
hand, and the second packet raised by the left. (2) The
top packet is placed under the second one, and gripped
by the left hand. (3) The right hand seizes the second
packet, and takes it from above the top one, which
remains held by the left thumb and finger. (4) The
second packet is shuffled into the cards remaining on the
table, and the top packet is dropped upon the whole.
(5) The pack is parted by drawing off the upper half with
the thumb and second finger of the right hand; at the
same moment the bridge is made, the upper half is put
under the lower, and the cards are given to be cut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Thus, both the shuffle and the bridge are included in one
complete operation.</p>

<p>We now come to the modern methods of 'stocking,'
or 'putting-up' hands. This, of course, includes the
third form of false shuffle. The simplest method of
stocking is accomplished in the act of picking up the
cards from the table preparatory to shuffling, and is
very useful in a game such as Nap. The player who is
about to deal notes among the cards lying upon the table
those which would provide him with a good hand.
With each hand he seizes one of them and immediately
after takes up as many indifferent cards as there are
players besides himself. He has then two cards 'put up.'
Again he picks up two more good cards in the same way,
and follows up with the proper number of indifferent ones,
as before. He has now four cards out of the five he
requires. With one hand therefore he picks up the
remaining card, with three others, and puts all the cards
thus taken up into one hand. The rest of the pack may
be picked up anyhow, care being taken to keep the
arranged cards on top. Then comes the shuffle. The
first thing to be done is to put on the top of the
selected card, which is uppermost, a similar number of
indifferent cards to that which is between each of the
selected ones, viz., as many as there are players besides
himself. Thus the cards he wants will come to him on
the deal. The rest of the shuffle is immaterial, so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
as the 'stock' is not interfered with. The end-bridge
may be worked for the cut, and all being well, he will
have the hand he prepared for himself. Some men can
do this picking-up with incredible rapidity and without
exciting the least suspicion on the part of their opponents.</p>

<p>Where the over-hand shuffle is used, the best way of
putting up a hand is by means of the process which is
called 'milking-down.' This is a manipulation which is
both simple and effective. The cards required to be
put up are placed all together at the bottom of the pack,
which is then taken endways between the thumb and
fingers of the left hand ready for shuffling, and the 'milking'
commences. We will suppose the game to be Nap,
and that three are playing. The dealer having put the
selected cards at the bottom in the course of gathering
the pack together, prepares to perform the over-hand
shuffle as above indicated. With the thumb of his
right hand he takes off one card from the top of the pack,
whilst at the same moment and in the same movement
the middle finger draws off one of the selected cards
from the bottom. At this point then he has two cards
in his right hand; one of those he has chosen, and an
indifferent one from the top of the pack above it. But
there are three players, so he must have two cards between
each of his own and the next, therefore he draws off
another from the top, over the two he already has in the
right hand. Again he draws off together a card from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
top and bottom, and over these places another from the
top. This is repeated until all the hand is put up, and
then the remainder of the pack is shuffled on to his forefinger
in the manner previously described in connection
with the over-hand shuffle. The stock is brought to
the top, the pack is parted, the bridge made, and the
cards are given to be cut.</p>

<p>Milking-down was originally used by Faro-dealers
for the purpose of putting up the high and low cards
alternately. The high ones being put all together at the
top of the pack, for instance, and the low ones at the
bottom, they were drawn down in pairs with great rapidity
and thus alternated. Nowadays, however, the process is
used for putting up hands for most games.</p>

<p>It is in connection with the riffle that the most skilful
putting-up is accomplished, but much practice and experience
are required to enable the manipulation to be
performed with certainty. In theory, however, the process
is simple. It consists of riffling between the selected
cards the proper number of indifferent ones. Suppose
that in a game of Nap the required cards have been put
at the top of the pack. The cards are divided and
riffled, taking care that none are allowed to go between
the selected ones except the first and second, which
must have the proper number between them. If there
are three players, this number will, of course, be two.
All that is necessary to effect this is to hold up the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
card with one thumb, and the last two cards of the other
half with the other thumb. The two cards are allowed
to fall upon the second of the selected cards, and the
top one is dropped over them. It is with the second
and following riffles, however, that the difficulty comes
in. In the second riffle, four cards have to be held up
and two dropped under them. In the third riffle, seven
cards have to be held up, and in the fourth, ten. The
fifth riffle merely puts two cards above the top selected
card, and the shuffle is complete. The great difficulty is to
know that the right number of cards is held up each
time, and that the right number is put between them. It
seems almost impossible that it can be done with certainty,
but there are plenty of sharps who can do it readily
enough without any mistake whatever. In fact, some
are so skilful with this shuffle that they can find any
cards they please by looking at the turned-up corners,
and place them in any position they please within the
pack.</p>

<p>In the game of Poker, when the pack has been
stocked for draft, either at the top or the bottom, after
the cut the sharp will place the two halves together in
the proper manner, but leaving a little break between
them. Thus he is enabled to know when the stocked
cards are being given off and who has them. Or he may
manage to hold back any that would be of use to him.
If the cards are held inclined slightly upwards, he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
frequently be enabled to draw back the top card as in
the 'second-deal,' and give off the next ones.</p>

<p>There is a single-handed pass sometimes used to
bring the stock to the top, which is performed under
cover of the right arm whilst reaching to the left. The
cards are held upon a level with the table-top, and as the
arm passes over them, those which are above the stock
are pressed with the fingers of the left hand against the
right elbow. Thus they are held for the moment whilst
the others are drawn from beneath, and as the right arm
returns, the stocked cards are brought to the top. In
this way the entire operation is performed under cover
of the arm, and is therefore undiscernible.</p>

<p>Where a confederate is available to cut the pack,
there is a form of false cut which appears to pass muster
in America pretty well. It consists of merely grasping
the pack in both hands, lifting it off the table, and pulling
it apart, so to speak. The half which comes from the
bottom is drawn upwards, thus appearing to come from
the top, in the same manner as the cards in the bottom-deal.
At the same time, the top half is drawn downwards,
appearing to come from the bottom. Then, when
the two halves are put together in their original position,
it looks as though the lower half had been put upon the
upper. Quickly done, this ruse is fairly successful.</p>

<p>Another form of false cut is somewhat similar in effect
to the French card-sharper's shuffle, and is used to retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a 'top stock' in its place. A third of the pack, or
thereabouts, is taken off with the right hand, and the
remainder is cut in two with the left. The top cards are
now placed upon those which remain on the table, the
second lot are thrown down beside them, and upon
these the other two packets are placed as one, bringing
the top cards into their original position. Thus, whilst
the pack is really cut into three, the only effect of the
cut is to bring the bottom cards into the middle; a result
which is of no consequence where only a top stock is
concerned.</p>

<p>We may conclude the present chapter with a description
of the system of cheating known as 'Counting-down.'
This is a method which is not by any means so familiar to
the masses as those with which we have just been dealing.
It is one of those devices which seem to lie within the
borderland between honesty and dishonesty; although,
when one understands its real nature, there is no question
as to the fact that it really <i>is</i> cheating, and nothing else.
It is the most scientific mode of swindling, in games
where only a few cards constitute a hand, that has ever
been devised, and it is so good that it almost defies
detection, even at the hands of an expert. It is just
that one word 'almost,' however, which qualifies its
absolute perfection. There is always some weak point
in a trick, however good.</p>

<p>Counting down is one of those operations which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
depend more on memory than sleight of hand. It requires
long practice and much skill, but the skill is rather
mental than manipulative. It is necessary that the sharp
who practises it should be able to memorise instantly as
many cards as possible. Comparatively few persons can
remember more than five cards at a glance. Not one in
a thousand can remember ten. There are some, however,
who can remember the order of a whole pack of fifty-two
cards, after seeing them dealt out rather slowly. Needless
to say there are not many individuals of the latter class.
All, however, use some system of artificial memory. Without
something of the kind, counting-down would be
impracticable.</p>

<p>The object of this system, of course, is to enable the
sharp to know the sequence of a certain number of cards
which are to be introduced into the play, and thus to be
certain of their value, and also of the hands in which they
are to be found. The possession of this knowledge is of
the utmost importance sometimes.</p>

<p>As a readily understood and familiar example, let us
suppose that the sharp is engaged in a single-handed game
of Nap, and that he can remember twelve cards, together
with the order in which they occur. His first duty
will be to note the manner in which his opponent
usually cuts, whether near the middle of the pack, near
the top or the bottom. Most people have some peculiarity
in this way which may be relied on. Suppose then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the sharp finds that the other man's cut is generally pretty
well in the centre. When it is his turn to deal, in the act
of shuffling he will place twelve cards in rapid succession
at the bottom of the pack, at the same time holding the
pack so that the faces of the cards are visible. He notes
these twelve cards, and the order in which they occur.
At the conclusion of the shuffle he leaves just so many
cards over them as he thinks the other will take off
in the cut; consequently, after cutting, those cards will
be at the top or nearly so. If the sharp is fortunate the
cut will come into the first one or two of them, and
then when the cards are dealt, he knows by looking at his
own hand precisely what cards his opponent holds. If
his own hand will allow him to 'go more' than his
opponent feels inclined to risk, he will do so, if not he
allows his opponent to play. In either case he knows perfectly
well what the result of the hand will be before a single
card is put down. Of course if the case should be that
he is playing against an unmistakable 'Nap' hand, and
that he has no cards the skilful playing of which will prevent
the other man from winning, he is bound to accept
the inevitable. But it is obvious that the advantages he
enjoys, compared with his antagonist, are enormous.</p>

<p>With a sharp who works the bottom-deal, the memorising
of five cards only is sufficient. He notes the five
cards and leaves them at the bottom of the pack which
is given to be cut. After the cutting, he picks up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
bottom half of the pack, leaving the other upon the table.
If the five cards at the bottom are good ones he deals them
to himself, but if, on the contrary, they are little ones,
which would make a bad hand, he deals them to his
opponent. He will always let the opponent have them
unless they are exceptionally good, because it is worth
more than half the game to know what cards one has to
contend with.</p>

<p>It is in the game of 'Poker,' however, that counting-down
is of the greatest assistance. The cards are dealt
round five to each player, and we will suppose it is the
sharp's turn to deal next. He throws his hand, face downwards,
on the table, and puts the rest of the pack on top of
it. He therefore knows the five bottom cards of the pack,
having memorised his hand. Even though some of the
other players may understand counting-down, no one will
suspect that any trickery is in progress, as the whole
proceeding is quite usual and perfectly natural.</p>

<p>Having the whole of the cards in a heap in front of
him, the sharp now takes them up to straighten or level
them, somewhat ostentatiously keeping their faces turned
well away from him, so that he cannot see a single card.
He does not overdo this appearance of honesty however.
That would be almost as fatal as an appearance of
cheating.</p>

<p>The cards being straightened, the shuffle has now to
be accomplished. In this case it will be one of the second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
or partial order. The sharp takes good care, in riffling
down or what not, to leave undisturbed the five cards he
has memorised, and finally to have them in such a position
within the pack, that the cut and deal will leave them at
the top. His object, of course, is to have the choice of
those five cards in the draft. If he has been fortunate
in his manipulation, the card which comes to him on the
last round of the deal will be one of those five. In that
case he knows the value of the two or three top cards,
and looking at his hand he can tell whether either of
them will be of use to him when it comes to his turn to
draw. If so, in giving off the draft to the other players,
he may, if opportunity serves, hold back the card or cards
he requires. Then the other hands being complete, he
can throw away a corresponding number of indifferent
cards from his hand and take the selected ones for himself.
Generally speaking, this method will enable him to
retain and utilise a card which, otherwise, he would have
thrown away as being useless, and very often enable him
to make 'two pair.'</p>

<p>It is manifest that however skilfully this may be done,
there is a strong element of uncertainty attaching to the
result. The player who cuts the pack may not divide it
in the right place by a card or two, and therefore it might
happen that the whole of the five cards may be distributed
in the deal. But it is bound to come right sometimes,
and then it is worth all the trouble and annoyance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
previous failures; but whether it is successful or not, it
is done as a matter of routine, and if only for the sake of
practice, every time the sharp has to deal. He cannot
exercise himself too much in such a difficult operation.
Still there is a good bit of chancework about it which is
not at all acceptable to the sharp, and to obviate this
two sharps will often work in secret partnership. The
dealer, having memorised his own hand, which he has
plenty of time to do thoroughly, waits until his partner's
cards are done with. When that moment arrives, the
accomplice passes his cards to the dealer in such a way
that their faces can be seen. These must be remembered
at a glance. The dealer has now ten cards to work with
instead of five, and thus the chances are far more than
proportionately greater. Some of the known cards are
<i>sure</i> to be at the top of the pack, ready for the draft, and
looking at the last card which has fallen to him on the
deal, the sharp can tell what they are. If, in addition, it
is the confederate who cuts the cards, of course the game
becomes too strong to be beaten. He is sure to cut the
pack at the right place.</p>

<p>If the sharp is a fine shuffler, with a good memory, well-trained
in this class of work, he can dispense with an
accomplice, and do quite as well without one. Supposing
it to be his turn to deal next, he looks at his hand, and
if the cards he holds are not of much consequence, he
'passes,' that is, he stands out of the game for the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
being. Meanwhile he gathers up the pack and discards,
and keeping the faces of the cards turned away from him
he evens them up in readiness for the deal. Then he
waits until the two or three hands that are being played
are called or shown up. With a glance, he remembers as
many of these cards as he conveniently can, places them
either at the top or bottom of the pack and 'holds' them
during the shuffle, arranging their position in the pack as
in the former cases.</p>

<p>The last card which comes to him on the deal being
one of these, he knows the sequence of several of the top
cards which remain in the pack. Consequently he not
only knows what he is giving off in the draft to others,
but also what remains for him when it is his turn to draw.
If, then, it suits him best to discard, as to which he does
not stand in doubt as the other players do, he throws
away according to the nature of the cards he will have to
draw from the pack to replace his discards. It really is
just the same thing as though he had two hands dealt to
him instead of one. He has the opportunity of making
his selection from at least twice as many cards as either
of his opponents.</p>

<p>Unless the reader should happen to be himself a high-class
sharp, he can have no idea of how well this is done
by some men who make it their speciality. It is a method
which renders a good shuffler—expressive term—with a
good system of artificial memory, well-nigh invincible at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
such a game as Poker. Counting-down is simple, when
you can do it; it is impossible of detection by ordinary
players, and best of all, <i>even smart gamblers will stand
the work</i>. After that no more need be said about it.</p>

<p>From the contents of this chapter, the expert reader
will see that in so far as manipulation pure and simple is
concerned, the sharp of to-day is in a position very little
better than that of his prototype of fifty years ago. If we
except the improved methods of 'stocking' and so on,
which have resulted from the introduction of new shuffles
and certain methods of preparing the cards, there are
hardly any new developments to record.</p>

<p>That this should be so, and indeed must of necessity
be so, will be evident to anyone who has made a study
of card-tricks. There are only certain manipulations
possible in connection with fifty-two pieces of pasteboard.
Generations of keen intellects have already made a study
of their possibilities; and like the 'old poets, fostered
under friendlier skies,' these have stolen all the best
ideas from their unhappy successors. And the worst
of it is the ideas have become more or less common
property.</p>

<p>To invent a new deception in the way of the manipulation
of cards is for all the world like trying to make
a new proposition in 'Euclid.' That ancient humb—philosopher
I should say—has covered the whole ground;
much to the disgust of that hypothetical example of encyclopædic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
information known as 'any schoolboy.' In
our time we have all of us tempered our regret that so
great a philosopher should ever die, with the far greater
regret that he should ever have lived. His loss would
have been 'any schoolboy's' infinite gain. Well, man is
born to Euclid as the sparks fly upward, and there is no
dodging the difficulty.</p>

<p>It is just the same in the fraudulent manipulation of
cards. All that can be done has been done. If it were
not so the sharp would be the gainer, therefore it is better
as it is.</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, it is quite possible to be a first-rate
sharp without being capable of performing the simplest
feat of dexterity. This sounds very much like
saying that a man might be a thorough mathematician
without knowing the multiplication-table, but the cases
are not exactly upon all fours. It is quite possible to
reason logically without having made the acquaintance
of that maid of mystery 'Barbara'; and it is quite possible
in like manner to be able to cheat without having
recourse to manipulation. It is a thing which is not
necessary, and more often than not it is attended with
the risk of detection.</p>

<p>The sharp has gone further afield in the augmentation
of his resources. He has pressed into his service
every device that human ingenuity can conceive or rascality
execute, every contrivance that skill can produce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and even the forces of Nature herself have been made to
serve his ends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unfortunate dupe has been laying the
flattering unction to his soul, that given the understanding
of certain primitive forms of manipulation, he has nothing
else to fear. Much he knows about it!</p>

<p>There is no fool like the fool who imagines himself
wise, and there is no dupe like the 'fly flat,'—the man
who 'thinks he knows a thing or two.'</p>

<p>Well, it is not the fault of this book if he is not
henceforth a wiser and a richer man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>COLLUSION AND CONSPIRACY</i></span></h2>

<p>The words which head this chapter are hard words.
One cannot deny it. They are intended to be so. Being
so, they belong to the class of utterances which, according
to the sages, 'break no bones.' This may be true
enough even of collusion and conspiracy. But in all
conscience, or the lack of it, these have broken hearts
and fortunes enough to compensate for any amount of
merely physical incapacity.</p>

<p>There cannot be the slightest doubt that a large
proportion of the cheating which goes on, in what is
called polite society, is accomplished by these means.
The high position of the players is, unfortunately, no
guarantee of fidelity. One may be cheated anywhere,
even in exclusive clubs of the most <i>recherché</i> character,
as many know to their cost. Practically, there is no high
and dry rock upon which the gambler can perch, and
say to the tide of cheating—'Thus far shalt thou
come, and no farther.' He is not safe anywhere, for he
can never tell who may not be tempted, at some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
or other, to resort to dishonest practices. The sharp is
not always a professional; he may, now and then, be an
amateur. Where the stakes are heavy, the temptation
to take an unfair advantage of an opponent is occasionally
too great for some to resist; especially where no
risk of detection is run in so doing. Accidental circumstances
will sometimes give a player overwhelming advantages
in the play, of which none but he are aware;
and who shall say that he will not avail himself of the
opportunity which chance has thrown in his way? Against
this sort of thing, however, there is no other safeguard
than the watchfulness of the players. Where,
then, is the 'game,' the amusement, if one has to play,
armed at all points, as it were, and living in dread of
pickpockets?</p>

<p>It is not with this sporadic kind of cheating, however,
that we now have to deal, but with the systematic banding
together of individuals to swindle at play. As a notable
example of this kind of thing, the reader will do well to
peruse the recital of the following incident, which occurred
a few winters ago at one of the leading clubs in the
West End of London.</p>

<p>At this club a very favourite game was écarté,
played generally 'à la galerie.' That is to say, the
bystanders were allowed to bet among themselves, or
with the players, as to the result of the game. In this
case, the lookers-on form themselves into two parties, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
behind each player, and lay wagers upon the chances of
their respective champions.</p>

<p>The doings of this club, then, afforded an opportunity
for cheating which was too good to be missed. Certain
unprincipled members therefore proposed, and managed
to get elected, two clever French card-sharpers. The
method of procedure adopted was to place these two
men opposed to each other at a card-table, and let
them play écarté. As large a 'gallery' as possible was
assembled, and then the fun began. There was nothing
of refinement or delicacy of operation in the method
employed. All that took place was simply that one or
the other of the players lost to order. According to how
the betting ran, that is to say, according to the player
whose winning would put the most money into the
pockets of the conspirators, so would the result of the
game be. Certain signs were made to the players,
unobserved of the outsiders, and in response to these
signs the game was made to go in one direction or the
other.</p>

<p>The favourite plan appeared to be for all the conspirators
to station themselves behind one of the men,
and, of course, other members of the club who wished to
join in had to take up their position behind the other.
The secret brotherhood then made as many bets with
those across the table as they could. When this had
been effected, their player was sure to win. If the cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
were not running favourably to him, he would put up
hands for himself, make the bridge, and give the cards
to be cut. No doubt, out of pure courtesy, his opponent
would obligingly cut at the required place. At the end
of the evening the proceeds were divided among the
conspirators.</p>

<p>Well, this little game had gone on for some time, and
had doubtless been the means of putting in circulation a
good deal of capital which otherwise would have remained
locked up, when a most unforeseen and regrettable
incident occurred. Among the newly-elected members
of the club was one who had some little knowledge of
sleight-of-hand. Chancing to be a spectator of the proceedings
one evening, he at once 'tumbled to the bridge.'
He might well do so, for, as one of the fraternity remarked,
the players had latterly become so secure in the
ignorance of the members that, owing to their carelessness,
the structure referred to had become not so much a
bridge as a veritable 'Arc de Triomphe.' Through the
enlightenment which was thus brought about, the matter
came to be laid before the committee. The result was
that Écarté à la Galerie was prohibited. Those who
are familiar with club matters will doubtless remember
the circumstance, and know the club to which allusion is
made.</p>

<p>A very necessary adjunct to collusion of almost any
kind is some system of secret telegraphy. With such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
system in operation between two or more players who
are in secret partnership, there are many games in which
winning can be made a certainty. The telegraphy, of
course, is seldom of a character which would permit
those acquainted with it to indulge in secret gossip, but
for the most part consists of signs which indicate the
names of the cards. Generally speaking there will be
two classes of indications, one for suit, and one for value.
For instance, if the player who is signalling is seen to lay
his right hand open upon the table, that may serve to
indicate hearts; if the hand, instead of lying flat, is resting
upon its side, that may mean spades; if clenched flat
on the table, clubs may be signified; and finally, if
clenched and thumb upwards, that may denote diamonds.
The values of the cards are no less easy to indicate. If
the telegraphist looks upwards, that may mean an ace;
if downwards, a king; if to the left, a queen; if straight
in front of him, a knave; if to the right, a ten; with
head on one side, and looking upward, a nine; ditto, and
looking to the right, an eight; ditto, and to the left a
seven, and so on through the whole number. There is
no difficulty in arranging a system of this kind, to be
worked either by word or sign, and such systems if
carefully thought out are very difficult to detect.</p>

<p>Suppose two partners at whist are in collusion and
one of them is about to lead. The other may desire him
to lead clubs. He may, therefore, address to anyone in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the room a sentence beginning, 'Can you tell me——'
The initial letter of the sentence indicates the suit which
he desires his partner to lead. If he wanted diamonds
he would say 'Do you know——' &amp;c. If it was necessary
to call for hearts he would observe, 'Have you seen——'
&amp;c. Lastly, if spades were in requisition he would ask
some question beginning, 'Shall you have——' These
things are all very simple, but they mean a great deal,
sometimes, in a game of cards.</p>

<p>Another system of signalling sometimes adopted is to
indicate the fact of certain cards being held by the
position in which the cards are laid upon the table. The
person signalling, having looked at his hand, wishes to
let his accomplice know that he holds a certain card of
importance in the game. Therefore, whilst waiting till
the other players have sorted their hands, he closes up
his cards for the moment, and lays them before him on
the table. The manner of their disposition will give the
required cue, or, as it is called, 'office.' The end of the
cards farthest from the operator may be taken to represent
a kind of pointer, which is set opposite to some
particular figure upon an imaginary dial, supposed to be
drawn upon the table. Several cards can be indicated
in this way, and for others additional factors can be
introduced. For instance, the cards may be spread a
little, the top card may project a little to one side or
over one end, or the operator may keep his fingers resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
upon the cards. In fact, the variety of signals is
infinite. From the laying down of a cigar to the taking
up of a glass of wine, from the opening of the mouth to
the stroking of the chin, every movement, however
simple and unsuspicious, can be made the means of
cheating at almost any game. A code of signals to
indicate every card in the pack, and no more difficult to
decipher than the Morse code in telegraphy, can be
arranged by anyone in five minutes. Indeed, the Morse
code itself can be used in connection with what the
French sharps call 'La dusse invisible,' a system of
signalling to an accomplice by pressure of the foot under
the table. In using this system care must, of course, be
taken not to tread on the wrong person's toes.</p>

<p>An instance of card-sharping, involving the use of
secret telegraphy, once came under the author's notice,
in connection with the projected exposure of a noted
card-sharp. The circumstances of the case arose in the
following manner.</p>

<p>It is well known that one of the most able and uncompromising
among exposers of fraud at the present
day is Mr. Henry Labouchere, M.P., the Editor and Proprietor
of 'Truth.' In the columns of that widely read
and influential publication, the trenchant criticisms and
fearless utterances of 'Scrutator' have done yeoman's
service in the cause of truth and justice.</p>

<p>The author has had the privilege upon several occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of being associated with Mr. Labouchere in the
running to earth of impostors of various kinds, and one
of those occasions was in connection with the case of the
sharp above referred to. Some of the details will doubtless
occur to the minds of those who recollect the name
of the man known as Lambri Pasha. It is advisable to
say 'known as,' for whether his real name was anything
resembling that there is nothing to show. If there is one
thing which one may be inclined to believe more than
another, it is that although Lambri the man may have
been, Pasha he certainly was not.</p>

<p>This man Lambri, then, an Italian by birth and a
sharp by profession, had carried on his operations upon
so large a scale as to bring himself prominently before
the notice of 'Scrutator.' As usual in such cases,
'Scrutator' proceeded to make short work of him.</p>

<p>At the time referred to, this Lambri happened to have
a quarrel with one of his accomplices, and in revenge
this man revealed to Mr. Labouchere the entire <i>modus
operandi</i> of the means used by his employer to cheat the
gamblers in those high circles to which he had obtained
access.</p>

<p>This being the case, the author was approached by
Mr. Labouchere with a view to arranging a plan of action
whereby the arch swindler might be caught red-handed,
and the exposure made complete. The following
scheme was accordingly devised. The author, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
guise of a country squire supposed to be of great wealth,
was to be presented to Lambri, and invited to join in the
game of baccarat, specially arranged for the 'staging' of
the little drama which was to follow.</p>

<p>Needless to say it was not proposed that the author,
although armed, should be alone in a venture which
promised to result in violence of a more or less pronounced
type. Among the other guests it was arranged
to have some whose daily avocations were not altogether
unconnected with Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Lambri's system was an exceedingly simple one. It
was worked with the assistance of a confederate, and
baccarat was the game principally favoured. In this
game three packs of cards are used in combination,
forming one large pack of 156 cards. It is obviously
impossible to hold this bulky pack in the hands with any
degree of convenience whilst the cards are being shuffled;
therefore the shuffle is accomplished by standing the
cards on edge upon the table with their faces turned away
from the dealer, and in this position they are mixed
together. Lambri, having taken the 'bank,' would proceed
to shuffle the cards in the manner described.
During this operation, and as the various cards were
brought to the front, the confederate, who had taken up a
convenient position, would indicate to his principal their
value by means of a code of signals arranged for that
purpose. From the explanations already given the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
reader will have no difficulty in deducing the manner
in which the cards were put up for the advantage of the
'bank.'</p>

<p>In order to detect this manœuvre, then, it would be
necessary to watch the proceedings from the commencement,
note the arrangement adopted, and at the right moment
give the signal for seizing both cards and dealer.</p>

<p>Preparations having been made for carrying this plan
into effect, and all due precautions having been taken, it
was hoped that Lambri would quietly walk into the snare
which had been set for him. 'The best laid schemes,'
however, 'gang aft agley.' Whether the confederate had
played fast and loose with both sides, which is more than
probable, or whether information had leaked out through
some other channel, it is impossible to say. Certain it is,
however, that Lambri obtained an inkling of what was in
progress, and took steps—or rather, 'made tracks'—accordingly.
The day previous to that decided upon for
the exposure the accomplice received a telegram from
Paris informing him that the object of our kind attentions,
owing to pressure of important business, would
be detained there for some weeks.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the affairs which so
suddenly called him to Paris were both pressing and
important; for, to all appearance, they have occupied his
attention ever since. That appointment has never been
kept, and, so far as can be ascertained, he has never from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that date to this put in an appearance in England. To
all his former friends and acquaintances he is 'lost to
sight,' though, to a great many of them, he undoubtedly
is 'to memory dear,' and <i>very</i> dear.</p>

<p>A sharp may generally be trusted to arrive at a sound
decision in all matters affecting his own interests; and it
certainly cannot be said that 'Lambri Pasha' has proved
himself to be an exception to the rule.</p>

<p>At baccarat collusion and conspiracy are generally
used for the purpose of 'rooking' some particular individual
of the pronounced 'Juggins' type, and the plan
of operation is somewhat as follows.</p>

<p>We will suppose that the field of action is the card-room
of some small club, where baccarat is played
clandestinely, and for heavy stakes. Among the members
who are addicted to this pastime there is one
youngster with more money than brains, and several of
the reverse characteristics. Half a dozen of these latter
habitués of the club will sit around a table prepared
for the game in an upper chamber, waiting the advent of
their victim. Upon the table in front of the dealer is
the shoe containing the proper number of packs: the
cards being arranged, we will say, to give six winning
coups to the bank, and then to lose right out to the end.
They are not playing—far from it, although the table may
be strewn with money. Theirs is a waiting game for the
present, and they are passing the time as best they can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
When the dupe arrives at the club it is whispered to
him that there is a little game in progress upstairs. His
arrival is signalled to the conspirators, and by the time
the innocent fledgling reaches the room, there is a game
apparently in full blast. The new-comer sees that the
bank is winning every time. At the end of the six winning
coups the dealer says he has won enough, or makes some
other excuse for retiring from the game. A new dealer
is therefore required, and it does not need much persuasion
to induce the 'mug' to take the bank. There is a
superstition to the effect that banks which commence
luckily for the dealer will continue so to the end, and the
unfortunate youth never suspects that it is a 'put-up job'
for him. Consequently he sits down to play, and naturally
he loses everything to the end of the deal. The
'Juggins,' however jubilant he may have been, soon
finds that he has no cause for rejoicing. You see,
when a man takes the bank in the middle of a game
he cannot have the cards shuffled, but must take them
just as they lie on the table, and continue the game from
the point at which the last dealer left it. If proceedings
of this kind are not to be stigmatised as wholesale
robbery, it is difficult to see how they are to be
described.</p>

<p>The most common method of cheating at poker in clubs
and private houses alike, but particularly in good society,
is one which is accomplished by means of collusion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
in connection with that process of the game known as
'raising out.'</p>

<p>In poker, the bets of the players are raised in rotation
around the table, and the players who wish to remain
'in'—that is to say, those who do not wish to forfeit what
they have already staked—must all have equal stakes in
the pool. Now, unless a man has a particularly good hand
he is not disposed to risk too much upon its chance of
winning; consequently, when the stakes have risen to a
certain amount, he will stand out rather than go beyond
what he has already risked.</p>

<p>Two men, then, in secret partnership, upon sitting down
to play, will contrive to get the man with most money, or
the best player (their greatest antagonist) between them.
Therefore, if these two men systematically raise their bets,
whether they have good hands or not, they must eventually
reach the point at which the other players will 'go out.' If
the man between them wishes to remain in, he must make
good, or, in other words, bring his stakes up to an amount
equal to those of the conspirators. This he may do for
some time, but sooner or later the game will become 'too
hot' for him and he will go out. He is between two fires,
and stands no chance whatever. Then, everyone else
having gone out, the game is in the hands of the two sharps,
and they can finish it in any way they think best. They
may keep on raising each other for a time, until at last
one of them refuses to stake another 'chip,' and throws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
away his hand, and then the other simply takes the pool.
Or one of them may 'call' the other, and upon seeing the
hand may throw his own away without showing it, the
inference being that it is not so good as that of his
supposed antagonist. There is really no need for the
other players to see either of the hands. They cannot
be called, because one or the other of them is always
raising his stakes, and until the stakes are made good
without anyone raising, the call is not complete and no
hands are shown. Then, when all the other players are
'raised out,' there is nobody left to call upon them to
show their hands. At the end of the evening, of course,
they divide the spoil.</p>

<p>These things may all appear to be very simple, but
they are extremely difficult of detection by outsiders.
Indeed, it is the very simplicity of collusion that constitutes
the great charm of its employment, and the great
safeguard against its detection. Unlike manipulation, it
can be accomplished by anyone and gives far less indication
of its existence. The only drawback to it is that where
there is a conspiracy there is always a chance of rogues
falling out, and honest men being put in possession of
the truth.</p>

<p>In every kind of game, and in every department of
trickery, collusion has been utilised as a ready means of
arriving at the consummation of the sharp's desires. It
is seldom, indeed, that a scheme of any magnitude is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
devised without more than one person concerned in it;
and the accomplices have assumed every kind of guise,
tinkers, tailors, soldiers, sailors, waiters, club-porters,
card-canvassers, and even officers of justice. There is no
end to the disguises in which these individuals have
appeared, and apparently no limit to their ingenuity.</p>

<p>One of the most immense frauds ever perpetrated in
connection with sharping, and in which the fewest persons
were concerned, was that recorded by Houdin. At the
outset it was entirely conceived and executed by one
sharp alone, although another took part in it at a later
stage, much to the disappointment of the original promoter
of the scheme. As this incident is of interest, and
exhibits in a striking manner the possibilities of cheating
which exist at all times and in all places, the reader shall
have the benefit of its perusal. Although the events
happened many years ago, the story is not very well
known, and is well worthy of retelling.</p>

<p>At the date of the narrative, Havana, according to
the historian, was the place most addicted to gambling of
any in the world. As he also observed, that was not saying
a little. And it was in that haven of delight that the
occurrences related took place.</p>

<p>A Spanish sharp, named Bianco, purchased in his
own country a tremendous stock of playing-cards; and, in
view of the undertaking in which he was about to embark,
he opened every one of the packs, marked all the cards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and sealed them up again in their wrappers. This he
did so skilfully that there was no evidence of the fact
that the packages had ever been tampered with. The
stupendous feat involved in a proceeding of this kind
being successfully accomplished, the cards were shipped
off to Havana and there disposed of to the card-dealers
at a ruinous sacrifice. So good indeed were these cards,
and so cheap, that in a very little while the dealers could
not be induced to purchase those of any other make.
Thus after a time there were hardly any cards circulating
in the place other than those which had been falsified by
Bianco.</p>

<p>The sharp, it may be imagined, was not long in following
upon the track of his cards; and being a man of
good address, he contrived to obtain introductions into
the best society. He played everywhere, of course, and
where he played he won. Hardly ever being called
upon to use any cards but his own, it is not surprising
that he should rapidly acquire wealth among people
whose chief recreation appeared to be gambling. To
avert suspicion, however, he was careful to complain
constantly of the losses he had sustained.</p>

<p>Among the various clubs in Havana was one which
was of the most exclusive kind. The committee was so
vigilant, and such great precautions were taken to prevent
the admission of doubtful characters, that hitherto it had
been kept free from the contamination of cheating. Into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
this club, however, Bianco contrived to effect an entrance,
and carried on his operations therein with much success.
He was destined, notwithstanding the zeal of the committee,
to remain alone in the field but a very short time.
Another sharp, a Frenchman this time, contrived also to
obtain admission to the club; and he, too, set to work to
prospect the country, thinking that he had possessed
himself of a gold-mine as yet unexploited.</p>

<p>Accordingly, this second adventurer, Laforcade by
name, seized a favourable opportunity of appropriating a
quantity of the club cards. These he took home with
him for the purpose of marking them, intending to
return them when marked to the stock from which they
had been taken. One may imagine the man's surprise
upon opening the packs to find that every card had
already been marked.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, somebody had been before him, and
Laforcade determined to find out who it could be. He
made inquiries as to where the cards were obtained,
and, purchasing some at the same place, found that these
also were marked. In fact, every pack that he could
procure had been tampered with in like manner. Here
then was a gigantic swindle, and he determined to
profit by it. He would let the other man do all the
work, but <i>he</i> would share in the profits. If the other
man, whoever he might be, would not listen to reason,
he would threaten to hand him over to the police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Having arrived at this decision, he set to work to
watch the play of the various members of the club, and,
naturally, the invariable good fortune of Bianco could
not fail to attract his attention. Keeping strict watch
upon that gentleman's proceedings, Laforcade soon
arrived at the conclusion that Bianco, and no other, was
the man of whom he was in search. He therefore took
an early opportunity of engaging his brother-swindler in
a quiet game of écarté, whilst no other members of the
club were present.</p>

<p>The game was played, and Bianco won, as a matter of
course. Then, as usual, the winner asked his opponent
if he was satisfied, or whether he would prefer to have
his revenge in another game. Much to his surprise,
however, instead of saying simply whether he preferred
to play again or not, the loser coolly rested his elbows
on the table, and regarding his adversary composedly,
gave him to understand that the entire secret of the
cheerful little deception which was being practised was
in his possession. This, of course, came rather as a
bomb-shell into Bianco's camp, and reduced him at
once to a condition in which any terms of compromise
would be acceptable, in preference to exposure and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Matters having arrived at this point, Laforcade
proposed terms upon which he was willing to come to
an understanding with the Spaniard. These were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
briefly, that Bianco should continue his system of
plunder, on condition that he handed over to his
fellow-cheat one-half of the proceeds. These terms
were agreed to, and upon that basis of settlement the
agreement was entered into.</p>

<p>For some time after this all went well with the two
swindlers. Laforcade established himself in luxury, and
gave his days to pleasure. Bianco ran all the risk; the
other had nothing to do but sit at home and receive his
share of the profits. It is true he could keep no check
upon his associate, to see that he divided the spoil
equitably; but, holding the sword of Damocles over him,
he could always threaten him with exposure if the profits
were not sufficiently great.</p>

<p>At length, however, Bianco began to tire of the
arrangement, which perhaps was only natural. Besides,
the supply of marked cards was beginning to run short,
and could not be depended upon much longer. This
being so, the prime mover of the plot having won as
much as he possibly could, promptly vacated the scene
of his exploits.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Laforcade thus found himself, as
the Americans say, 'left.' The prospect was not
altogether a pleasant one for him. He had acquired
expensive tastes which he might no longer be enabled
to indulge; he had accustomed himself to luxuries
he could no longer hope to enjoy. He had not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
skill of the departed Bianco; yet, nevertheless, he was
compelled to (metaphorically) roll up his sleeves and
work for his living. Things were not so bad as they
might have been. There was still a good number of
falsified cards in use; so he determined to make the best
possible use of his opportunities while they remained.</p>

<p>He therefore set to work with ardour, and success
largely attended his efforts. At last, however, the crash
came. He was detected in cheating, and the whole
secret of the marked cards was brought to light.</p>

<p>Even in this unfortunate predicament Laforcade's
good-fortune, strange to say, did not desert him. He
was taken before the Tribunal, tried, and <i>acquitted</i>.
Absolutely nothing could be proved against him. It is
true the cards were marked, but then, so were nearly all
the others in Havana. Laforcade did not mark them, as
was proved in the evidence. He did not import them.
To all intents and purposes he had nothing to do with
them whatever. It could not even be proved that he
knew of the cards being marked at all. Thus the case
against him broke down utterly, and he got off scot free.
It is, nevertheless, presumable that he did not long remain
in that part of the world. As to what became of Bianco,
nothing is known. Possibly his record concluded with
the familiar words 'lived happily ever after'; but most
probably not. The end of such men is seldom a happy
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
The recital of the above-mentioned circumstances
will serve to accentuate the contention that it is impossible
wholly to guard against cheating. Here was a case
in which the utmost caution was observed, in order to
exclude cheats and impostors from a club; and yet it is
seen that, within a very short time, two men of the sharp
persuasion contrived to effect an entrance. If this is
possible in the case of a club, where there is not only a
committee to investigate the <i>bona fides</i> of every applicant
for membership, but also a large body of members presumably
alive to their own interests who have to be satisfied
of the fitness of the candidates for election, what
chance has a mere private individual of protecting himself
against the sharp and his insidious ways? Those two
men, Bianco and Laforcade, must have had friends among
the inhabitants of Havana, friends who would have been
horrified to know the real character of those whose
intimacy they found so agreeable. Among the dupes of
those two adventurers there must have been some who
would have resented bitterly any aspersion of the honesty
of their associates. We have seen the return they gained
for their friendship, and what has happened once may
happen again.</p>

<p>There is only one course to pursue of which it can
be said that it is absolutely safe. It is an extremely
objectionable one, no doubt; but we are speaking, just
now, of absolute safety. There is nothing for it but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<i>suspect your best friend, if he is a gambler</i>. The desire
for gain affects equally the high and the low. The
instinct of theft is rife alike in rich and poor. To use a
colloquialism, all are tarred with the same brush. The
only difference is that what is called stealing in the poor
starving wretch who takes a loaf, to save the parish the
expense of a funeral, becomes, in the case of his more
fortunate and richer fellow-sinner, merely a little intellectual
peculiarity, which is dignified with the name of
kleptomania. The poor man envies the rich man his
wealth; the rich man envies the poor man his solitary
ewe lamb. Instances of this kind have never been
wanting at any time in the world's history, and even in
matters of everyday life; but once a man becomes a
gambler, there is every prospect that his desire for gain
will eventually overmaster all the finer feelings of his
nature. You doubt it? Well, search the columns of
your newspaper, and every day you shall find at least one
case where some foolish fellow has stolen property, or
money, entrusted to his care, and has devoted the
proceeds of his theft to gambling purposes. There is
every reason in the world for suspecting anyone of dishonesty
who is found to have taken to gambling. If it
is not so, then all history lies, and past experience counts
for nothing.</p>

<p>Closely allied to the subject of conspiracy is that of
the maintenance of places in which gambling is systematically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
carried on, in defiance of the law, and in spite of the
utmost watchfulness of the police. It is true that one of
the most familiar head-lines upon the newspaper placards
is: 'Raid on a Club! The accused at Bow Street.'
Every week our attention is attracted by some announcement
of that kind, made in letters six inches high. But
we hardly ever give the matter a second thought; the
whole thing is too common an occurrence. Yet not one
tithe of these gambling-dens is ferreted out. Crushed
here to-day, they spring up there to-morrow. They are
perennial. Like the phœnix, they arise from their own
ashes—but under another name. And where the players
are to be found, there will the sharps be gathered together.
That is a thing which goes without saying, and is open to
no manner of doubt.</p>

<p>In these cases, of course, both sharps and flats are
drawn together by one common bond of union—that of
defeating the aim of the law for the suppression of gaming-houses.
The dupe merely sees in the efforts of the
Government to protect him from the consequences of his
folly an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the
subject. Therefore, he conspires with the sharp to run
counter to the law, and thus plays right into the hands
of his natural enemy. That he suffers in consequence
is no one's fault but his own; unfortunately, it is not he
alone who suffers. Those who are nearest, and should
be dearest, to him are those who suffer most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The devices resorted to by the occupants of
clandestine gaming-houses in order to conceal all traces
of the appliances used for the purpose of gambling
would fill many volumes in their description, but as they
do not form part and parcel of our subject we cannot
enter into an account of them. Probably one of the
most ingenious ideas ever conceived for the immediate
removal of all signs of gaming apparatus in the event of
a police raid, was that which was actually utilised at a
so-called club a good many years ago. The plan was
briefly this. Upon the fire in the card-room a large
kettle of water was kept constantly boiling, ostensibly for
the purpose of diluting the ardent liquors imbibed by the
members. The whole of the gaming utensils, dice-boxes
and everything else, were made of one of the alloys
known as fusible metals, which melt at a lower temperature
than boiling water. An alloy of bismuth, tin, lead
and cadmium can be made to melt at a far lower
temperature than that of boiling water. In the event of
a raid being made upon the club, then, the whole of the
appliances were put into the kettle, where they at once
melted, and even though any one looked in the kettle
during the search there was nothing to be seen.</p>

<p>It is in places of this kind where collusion and conspiracy
are most rampant. Those who have the ability
to devise methods of cheating the police may well be
supposed to have sufficient ingenuity to cheat the players.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Those who <i>must</i> gamble, therefore, should be very wary
when they entrust themselves and their money to the
tender mercies of the society encountered at such resorts.
With this word of caution we will bring the present
chapter to a conclusion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE GAME OF FARO</i></span></h2>

<p>Faro may almost be said to occupy in America the
position of a national game. The methods of cheating
used in connection with it are so numerous and so
ingenious that it becomes really necessary to devote an
entire chapter specially to them. Since there are parts
of the world, however, outside America where the game
is little known, and since it is necessary that the reader
should understand something of it to enable him to follow
the explanations, the first step must be to give some
little idea of the nature of the game and the manner
in which it is played. The following paragraphs, then,
will contain a brief description of its salient features,
and also of the apparatus or tools which are required
in playing it.</p>

<p>We will commence with the accessories first. These
are: (1) the faro-box, (2) the check-rack, (3) the
cue-keeper, (4) cue-cards, (5) the shuffling-board,
(6) the layout, and (7) the faro-table. These, together
with a pack of playing-cards, constitute the apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
employed. Let us take the various items in their order
as given.</p>

<p>1. <i>The faro-box.</i>—This is a metal box in which the
cards are placed, face upwards, and from which they are
dealt one at a time. Fig. 37 illustrates the back view of
such a dealing-box.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_208.jpg" alt="" width="445" height="177"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 37.</span>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that the box is open at the back, and
cut away at the top sufficiently to allow a large portion
of the face of the top card to be visible. The plate
forming the top overlaps the front side about one-eighth
of an inch, and below its front edge is a slit, only just
sufficiently wide to allow one card at a time to be pushed
out, so that the cards are bound to be dealt one by one,
and in the order they occupy in the pack. They are
slipped out by the thumb, which presses upon them
through the aperture in the top plate. The cards are
inserted through the back, and constantly pressed upwards
by a movable plate or partition, below which are
springs sufficiently strong for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
It is presumable that the object of this box is to
prevent any possibility of the cards being tampered with.
That it not only can be made to fail in this purpose, but
also to play directly into the hands of the cheat, we shall
see later on.</p>

<p>2. <i>The check-rack.</i>—This is a polished wooden tray,
lined with billiard-cloth. It is used by the dealer, to
contain his piles of counters and his money. It stands
at his left hand, upon the faro-table, during play.</p>

<p>3. <i>The cue-keeper, or cue-box.</i>—This is a piece of
apparatus used for the purpose of recording the cards as
they are played, and is under the control of a man who
is specially told off to attend to it. By its means at
any stage of the game the players can see at a glance
what cards have already been played, and what remain
in the pack. It is constructed upon the principle of the
ancient 'abacus' or 'obolus,' and consists of a framework
of wood, supporting thirteen wires, upon each of which
slide four small balls (fig. 38).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_210.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="330"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 38.</span>
</div>

<p>Opposite each wire there is attached to the framework
a miniature reproduction of one of the cards of a suit.
In faro, as in poker, the suit of any card is of no
importance. For all practical purposes the pack may
be considered as consisting simply of four aces, four
kings, four queens, and so on. Therefore, no record is
kept of the suits of the cards which have been played,
but only of their values. The position of the balls at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the commencement of the game is at the left hand
side of their respective divisions, as shown in the illustration.
When a king, for example, is drawn out of the
box, one ball, opposite the miniature king on the cue-keeper,
is slipped to the right, and so on until all the
fifty-two cards have been played, when, of course, the
whole of the balls are at the right of the apparatus. The
person who registers the progress of the game with this
accessory is styled the 'case-keeper.'</p>

<p>4. <i>Cue-cards.</i>—These are small cards upon which are
printed the names of the thirteen cards, a space being
left opposite each name, for the purpose of enabling the
players to check off the cards as they are played. They
are sometimes used in place of a case-keeper; but, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
where a case-keeper is employed, they are utilised by
the players for recording the winning and losing cards.
Any card which wins is marked with a cross, and one
which loses is marked with a nought. Fig. 39 represents
a cue-card which has been partially filled up in this way,
and the cards which have been played so far, it will be
noticed, are readily distinguishable. The cards lost are
two queens, two nines, two sevens, and three sixes.
Besides showing what cards have been lost and won, the
cue-card also tells what cards have yet to be played.
Thus, at the stage of the game indicated in fig. 39,
there are still remaining in the dealing-box one queen,
one nine, three eights, two sevens, two fives, four fours,
and three twos. This convenient record prevents the
possibility of a player betting upon cards which have
already been played.</p>

<p class="p0 caption smcap">Fig. 39.</p>

<p>The case-keeper and cue-cards were primarily introduced
with the object of keeping a check upon the dealer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and of preventing him from using a pack containing
more than fifty-two cards, or in which there was not the
right number of each value. We shall see presently how
he manages to get over that difficulty.</p>

<p>5. <i>The shuffling-board.</i>—This is a thin slab of wood
or metal, covered with billiard-cloth. It stands in front
of the dealer, and upon it are placed the faro-box and
the piles of winning and losing cards. It is upon this
board, also, that the cards are shuffled; hence its name.</p>

<p>6. <i>The layout.</i>—The designation of this adjunct to
the game is derived from the fact that it forms that part
of the table upon which the players 'lay out' their stakes.
Usually it is a green cloth, having painted upon it a
representation of the thirteen cards of one suit (see
diagram of the faro-table, fig. 40).</p>

<p>7. <i>The faro-table.</i>—This is simply an oblong table,
having a recess or cavity cut out in the centre of one of
the long sides. In this recess the dealer sits, being thus
enabled to be as near to the layout as possible, and at the
same time to have all his appliances within easy reach.
Fig. 40 will give the reader a clear idea of the relative
positions occupied by the dealer, the players, and the
various component items of the apparatus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_213.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="327"><br>

    <p class="p0 center"><span class="smcap">a</span>, shuffling-board. <span class="smcap i2">b</span>, faro-box. <span class="smcap i2">c</span>, pile of losing cards.<br>

    <span class="smcap">g</span>, layout. <span class="smcap i2">h</span>, dealer. <span class="smcap i2">i, i, i, i, i</span>, players.</p>
</div>

<p>The appliances above described being available, the
game is played in the following manner:—</p>

<p>At the termination of a deal the cards are all lying
face upwards upon the shuffling-board in two heaps at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
'C' and 'D,' and the faro-box is empty. Without taking
the cards off the table, but simply turning them back upwards,
the dealer mixes the two heaps together. The
pack is then cut and placed with the faces of the cards
upwards in the dealing-box. The players then stake
their money, placing their stakes upon the layout over
the card which they think will win. Each player, of
course, may select any card he pleases, irrespective of the
fact that another player may choose to bet upon the
same card. In fact, they can all back the same card if
they like. This, however, is a case which is rather rare,
anyhow at the outset of a game. Meanwhile the top
card of the pack has all along been visible to the players,
through the aperture in the top of the box. This card,
therefore, counts for nothing, and no bets can be made
with respect to it. From the top card downwards, the
cards alternately win for the players and the 'bank,' or
dealer. The second card, then, when displayed will win
for the players.</p>

<p>All the bets having been made, the dealer draws off
the top card and discloses the face of the second. The
top card is placed upon the shuffling-board in the position
indicated by 'C' (fig. 40), and those players who
have staked their money upon the card in the layout
which corresponds in value to the card which is now
seen through the window of the dealing-box will have to
receive from the dealer the amount of their stakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
If no player has bet upon that card the dealer of course
has to pay nothing.</p>

<p>The dealer has now to draw off another card from
the box and display the face of the third. As explained
above, this card will win for the bank. The second
card is therefore drawn off, and placed upon the shuffling-board
at 'D,' and the players who have staked their
money upon the card representing the one which is now
visible will lose their stakes to the dealer.</p>

<p>The two cards thus played constitute what is called a
'turn.' After each turn the dealer pays the money he
has lost and receives what he has won. All money
staked upon cards other than those which have either
won or lost remains undisturbed upon the layout. The
players are then at liberty to rearrange their bets in any
manner they may think fit, and the game continues.
Again the top card is removed from the box, revealing a
fourth, and placed upon the card already at 'C.' As
before, those who have staked upon the card now showing
in the box receive the amount of their bets in due course.
And so on until no more cards remain in the box.</p>

<p>There is one advantage enjoyed by the dealer in which
the other players do not participate. When it so happens
that both cards of a 'turn' are of the same value, both
kings, for instance, such an occurrence is termed a 'split,'
and a split means that the bank loses nothing, but, on the
contrary, takes half the money, if any, which is lying upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the card of that value in the layout. This advantage or
<i>refait</i> gives the bank a preponderance of the chances to
the amount of about three per cent.</p>

<p>The above is the simplest form of the game; but, in
reality, it is usually played in a more complicated manner.
For instance, the players can 'string their bets'; that is
to say, they can bet on more than one card at a time. A
counter placed between any two cards signifies backing
either of the two cards to win, and then the player will win
if either of those cards wins, or lose if either loses, and so
on. A single counter may be so placed as to back all the
high cards to win, and the low ones to lose, or <i>vice versa</i>.
By 'coppering,' or, in other words, placing a special counter
called a 'copper,' upon his stake, a player can bet that any
card will lose instead of win.</p>

<p>With this short explanation of the game, we will proceed
to consider the various methods of cheating at
faro.</p>

<p>The swindling which is practised in connection with
this game, and for which it affords ample scope, may be
divided into two kinds. Firstly, where the players cheat
the bank; and secondly, where the bank cheats the
players. This latter class may again be considered under
two heads, viz. cheating with fair cards and fair boxes,
and cheating by means of prepared cards and mechanical
arrangements connected with the faro-box and other appliances
of the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
We will take, first of all, the methods employed by the
players to cheat the bank. This is done where the players
are professional sharps who have contrived to 'put up a
mug' (<i>i.e.</i> to persuade a dupe) to take the bank. The
general practice is for one of the conspirators to have a
room of his own laid out for the game, and into this very
private room the victim is decoyed. In a case of this kind
the 'rig is worked,' or in other words the swindle is perpetrated,
by means of a dealing-box, so constructed as to
enable the players to know what cards will win for them,
and what will win for the bank. With this knowledge they
run no risk of staking their money on the wrong cards.
The contrivances for effecting this desirable result are
known as 'tell-boxes.' Broadly speaking, these are of two
kinds, the 'sand-tell' and the 'needle-tell.'</p>

<p>The sand-tell box is so called because it is used
in conjunction with prepared cards, which have been
'sanded' or roughened on one side, or both sides, as the
case may be.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The cards which are intended to 'tell'
are left smooth on their faces; all the others are slightly
roughened on both sides. The effect of this mode of
preparation is that, whilst the cards which are roughened
on both sides will tend to cling together, any card which
lies immediately upon the smooth face of a 'tell-card' will
slip easily.</p>

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 41.</span>
</div>

<p>The box with which these cards are used is shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
fig. 41, which represents a section taken through the
centre of the box, from top to bottom. Referring to 'A'
in the illustration, <i>s</i>, <i>s</i> are two of the springs which press
upwards upon the partition <i>p</i>, this in turn keeping the
cards tightly pressed against the top of the box, in which
the aperture or window <i>w</i> is cut. These details are of
course common to all dealing-boxes, as already explained.
The trickery, however, in this instance is in connection
with the front side of the box. Instead of being of an
equal thickness all round, the front is made double.
That is to say, an additional plate of metal is put inside
the box, covering the whole of the front plate, except
that it does not reach the top by the thickness of two
cards.</p>

<p>'B' in the illustration represents an enlarged sectional
view of the mouth of the box. The additional
plate is shown at <i>a</i>; <i>b</i> is the normal thickness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
front, and <i>c</i> is the slit through which the cards are
pushed out.</p>

<p>The prepared cards being put into a box of this
description, the effect produced in dealing is as follows.
If the third card from the top is one of those which has
been roughened on both sides, the second card will adhere
to it; consequently the act of drawing off the top card
will not cause the second to alter its position in the box.
If, however, the third card should happen to be one of
the tell-cards, whose face has been left smooth, the top
card will draw the second one a little distance to the right
over the top of the plate <i>a</i>. The second card, however,
cannot be drawn right out, because the slit <i>c</i> is not wide
enough to allow more than one card to pass at a time.
It is obvious, then, that if the players have some means
of knowing whether the second card moves or not, they
can tell whether the card immediately underneath it is a
tell-card or the reverse.</p>

<p>On reference to the illustration it will be manifest
that the actual distance moved by the second card when
drawn aside in this way can only be very slight. Indeed,
it would not do to allow of much movement, or the
dealer might notice it. Therefore, special means have
to be adopted to enable the sharps to detect the small
difference in the position of the cards. The necessary
indication is readily obtained by means of what are known
as 'sighters.' These are simply minute dots upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
faces of the cards. Upon each card one of these dots is
placed, in such a position that when the card comes to
the top the dot will be close to the edge of the aperture,
but if the one below it is a smooth or tell-card, the
slipping sideways of the card brings the dot away
from the edge, and it appears farther to the centre of
the opening. Fig. 42 is a diagram representing the
top of a sand-tell box under both conditions. The
dot marked <i>m</i> is the sight. In practice, it is much finer
than here shown, being in fact only just visible. 'A' indicates
the position of the dot when the card below
happens to be one which has been roughened. 'B' shows
the card drawn to one side, bringing the dot away from
the edge, thus intimating the fact that the card immediately
underneath is a tell-card, the face of which has been
left smooth.</p>

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 42.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
The general practice is to make all the court cards
'tell.' The advantage thus gained is that it is not
necessary to bet on any particular card, but simply to
back the high cards to win and the low ones to lose, or
<i>vice versa</i>. This is not so liable to cause suspicion as
having all the aces, for instance, to tell. In a case of this
latter kind, the slipping of the card would indicate that
the next card to be revealed would be an ace; therefore, if
the conspirators are to win, at least one of them must bet
upon an ace turning up. Whereas, if all the picture cards
are made to tell, not only are there more tell-cards in
the pack, but it is only necessary for one player to bet
upon the high cards generally. The box simply tells
them that a high card will show next, and they make their
bets accordingly.</p>

<p>Of course, it would never do for all the players to stake
their money alike. That would let the cat out of the bag,
with a vengeance. No; if the next card is to be a high
card, one of them will bet upon the high cards; the
others will bet upon particular small cards, avoiding the
high ones. They cannot possibly lose on the next card,
because they know that it is not one of the low cards
which comes next.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, in the description given of
the game, we saw that the bets are made just before the
dealing out of each pair of cards or 'turn.' Therefore
the indication given by the tell-box is only of use to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
players before a turn commences, that is to say, before
the first card of the pair is shown. They cannot change
their bets until the second card of the pair is shown and
the turn is played. Therefore, supposing the box indicates
that the first card of the next turn, the one that
wins for the players, is a court card, and that one of the
players has consequently backed the high cards, the
others must be careful how they arrange their bets. It
may happen that one of them has put his money upon a
card which will be the next to turn up; and this being
the one which wins for the bank, that stake will be lost.
Therefore, they have to arrange matters so that the
highest stake which can possibly be won by the dealer
is less than that of the player who has staked his money
upon the card or cards which they know will win on the
first draw. Or it may be that the other players will
'copper' their bets upon the low cards and thus play for
absolute safety.</p>

<p>These manœuvres are necessary, and are here pointed
out because they may be of assistance as a guide to
the investigation of suspected cases of cheating by
the means just described. If it should be found that,
in a game of faro, it constantly happens that one of
the players—not necessarily the same player—always
wins on the first card of a turn, and that on the second
card the others either do not lose at all, or, at any
rate, that the amount which either of them loses is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
less than that which the other has won, it may be
safely inferred that cheating is in progress.</p>

<p>The second kind of tell-box, which is used for the
same purpose as that we have just investigated, we have
already referred to as the 'needle-tell.' This box is
also used with prepared cards, but the preparation is of
a very different kind. In this instance there is no roughening
of the surfaces of the cards, but those which are
required to tell are cut to a slightly different shape to
the others. In some respects the needle is an improvement
upon the sand-tell; the cards are more easily
shuffled than is the case with the 'sanded' ones, the
clinging of which might arouse suspicion with an intelligent
dealer. The dealing-box, however, is more
complicated in its construction.</p>

<p>The tell-cards are cut with a slight projection at one
end. Fig. 43 will give an idea of the exact shape. The
projecting end will be noticed at <i>a</i>. Needless to say, in
the cards actually used the defect in the card would not
be more pronounced than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_224.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="270"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 43.</span>
</div>

<p>The dealing-box is so constructed that when either
of the tell-cards arrives at a certain position (usually the
fourth or eighth card from the top) the projecting corner
presses against a light spring and causes a little 'needle'
or point to project from the side of the box. Frequently
one of the rivets with which the box is put together is
made to push out a little. Whatever the index may be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
however, it does not move sufficiently to attract attention.
It is only those who are looking for it who know when it
'tells.' A movement of one thirty-second of an inch is
ample for the sharp eyes of the swindlers to detect.</p>

<p>The mechanism of the needle-tell, however, is not
used solely in connection with cases where the players
cheat the bank, it also forms a very necessary accessory
to the 'two-card' box to be presently explained. Then
it is used to let the dealer know when he is coming to
the 'odd,' or fifty-third card.</p>

<p>Having thus elucidated the comparatively simple
methods used to cheat the dealer, we now proceed to
investigate the more complex devices employed in those
cases where the bank cheats the players. As stated in
the earlier part of this chapter, the players may be
swindled either with fair cards and a fair dealing-box, or
by means of mechanical appliances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
When the dealer elects to cheat without the use of
mechanism, he is, of course, compelled to resort to
manipulation, and to 'put up' the cards in such a way
that they will help him to win. The reader will doubtless
remember that in the description of the game 'splits'
were mentioned as winning for the dealer. That is,
when both cards of a turn are of the same value, the
dealer takes half the money staked on the card which
has split, or turned up twice in succession, the suits, of
course, not counting. It is obvious, then, that if the
dealer in shuffling the pack can contrive to put up a
number of cards in pairs of the same value, his chances
of winning are greatly enhanced. Splits, therefore, are
the stronghold of the faro dealer's manipulation. If he
can only make them plentiful enough without leading
the players to suspect anything wrong, he is bound to
win in the long run, and to win plenty.</p>

<p>Whilst dealing out the cards in the first game, the
dealer determines in his own mind what cards he will
make split in the second game. We will suppose he has
just drawn a nine from the box, and that this card has to
go into pile 'C' (fig. 40). Now, by the laws of the game
he is bound to place this card upon the top of the pile
to which it belongs, therefore he does so. He may,
however, with apparent carelessness, place it just a little
on one side, so that he can distinguish it from the other
cards. He now waits for the appearance of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
nine, and this time one which will have to go into the
other pile, 'D.' This one is disposed in the same
manner. He has in sight, therefore, two cards of the
same value, and if these two cards can be brought
together during the shuffle, they will constitute a split.
Seizing a favourable opportunity in evening up the two
piles of cards, he may skilfully 'strip' the two nines—that
is, draw them out from the others and place them
at the bottom of their respective piles. There is no fear
of losing them now; they are always to hand when
required.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, however, that the cards should be
put at the bottom. So long as they are each in the same
position, in the pile to which they respectively belong,
that is all the dealer needs. Suppose the ninth card
from the bottom of pile 'C' to be a king, all the man
wants is to have the ninth card of pile 'D' a king also.
If, therefore, the ninth card of that heap is placed a little
to one side, and all the succeeding cards are put above it
in like manner, that will leave a division in the pile, into
which a king can be stripped at a convenient moment.</p>

<p>If the players are sufficiently lax to allow the dealer to
throw the cards carelessly into two heaps, instead of
making two even piles, the case is, of course, much simplified.
He has only to put the cards directly at the bottom
or wherever else he may desire to have them.</p>

<p>Given the fact of certain cards having been placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
pairs, one of each pair in the same position within its pile,
the problem which presents itself for solution is, How can
the dealer shuffle the two piles one into the other, so as to
bring the proper cards together? In short, How are the
splits put up?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_228.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="318"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 44.</span>
</div>

<p>This is accomplished by means of what is called the
'faro dealer's shuffle.' It must not be thought that this
manipulative device is essentially a trick for cheating; on
the contrary, it is an exceedingly fair and honest shuffle,
provided that there has been no previous arrangement of
the cards. By its use, a pack which has been divided into
two equal portions may have all the cards of one half placed
alternately with those of the other half at one operation.
In faro, the manner of dealing the cards necessarily
divides them into two equal parts. This being the case,
they are taken up by the dealer, one in each hand.
Holding them by the ends, he presses the two halves
together so as to bend them somewhat after the manner
shown in fig. 44, in the position 'A.' The halves are
now 'wriggled' from side to side in opposite directions,
with what would be called in mechanism a 'laterally
reciprocating motion.' This causes the cards to fly up
one by one, from either side alternately, as indicated in
the figure at 'B.' Thus it is evident that those cards
which have been placed, with malice aforethought, in
corresponding positions in the two piles, will come
together in a shuffle of this kind, and form splits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
This shuffle is a very difficult one to learn; but with
practice and patience it can be accomplished, and the
cards can be made to fly up alternately, without any
chance of failure. A dealer, skilled in the devices we have
just touched upon, can put up four or five splits in one
deal, if he thinks it advisable so to do. By the use of such
means he is also enabled to arrange the cards so as to
checkmate any player who may appear to be following
some particular system of betting. Finding that the
players are, on the whole, inclined to back the high cards,
the dealer may so arrange the pack that the low cards
only win for them, the high ones falling to the bank. In
this, however, he runs a great risk. It may happen that
the players, finding themselves constantly losing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
high cards, may alter their mode of play, and back the low
ones. That would be bad for the bank unless the dealer
had a mechanical box which enabled him to alter the run
of the cards. Such boxes, however, are obtainable; and
their description is included in the branch of our subject
which treats of cheating the players by means of
mechanical contrivances, and to which we now proceed.</p>

<p>In cases where the dealer uses apparatus for cheating,
his requirements are three in number. Firstly, he must
have what is known as a 'two-card' dealing-box, that is,
a box which will allow him, whenever he pleases, to withdraw
two cards at one time, instead of compelling him to
deal them singly. Secondly, he must have an 'odd,' or
fifty-third card. Lastly, he requires a mechanical shuffling-board,
which adds the 'odd' to the pack, after the cards
have been counted at the commencement of the game.</p>

<p>The two-card box is one of the most expensive
cheating tools a sharp can use. The prices charged for
them are something exorbitant, as may be seen on
reference to the catalogues. To be of any use, however,
they must be well-made, and then they will earn their
cost in a very little time. Badly-made, the sharp would
find that, however cheap they appeared to be, they would
really be the most expensive and ruinous contrivances he
had ever known. They are made in many varieties, and
known by as many poetic names, but the effect is the same
in all cases. Pressure being applied to some part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
box, the mouth is caused to open sufficiently wide to allow
two cards to be drawn out together. The best boxes are
those high-priced commodities of which the catalogues
say that they will 'lock up to a square box.' This does
not mean a rectangular box, but a box that will bear
examination. 'Fair' and 'square,' in this instance, mean
the same thing. The only fault in the description is that
the box, being false, cannot possibly become genuine
with any amount of locking. It should be said that when
locked it <i>appears</i> to be genuine, and may be examined
without fear of the trick being detected. Some boxes are
made to lock by sliding them along the table. The bottom
moves a little, this movement serving to fix all the movable
parts. Some are so arranged that they are always locked.
That is their normal condition, so they can be examined
at any time. When it is required to widen the mouth
and allow two cards to pass out together, a small piece of
wire, or 'needle' as it is called, is made to rise out of the
shuffling-board or table; this, pressing against one of the
rivets, or into a little hole in the bottom of the box,
unlocks the mechanism for the moment. Another form
of the two-card box is one which has the bottom plate
made of very thin metal, the 'springing in' of which, when
pressed upon in the centre, unlocks the 'fake.' Some of
the forms which unlock by sliding on the table are the
most complicated, requiring sometimes three movements
to free the working parts and allow the slit to widen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The movements, of course, have to follow in proper
succession, as in any other kind of combination-lock.
This prevents any accidental unlocking of the box whilst
it is in the hands of strangers.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the game, then, the cards are
counted to make sure that there are the proper number,
and we will suppose that the dealing-box is a two-card
with needle-tell attachment. One of the cards in the
pack, therefore, will be cut with the projecting corner.
We will suppose it to be the king of diamonds. Another
king of diamonds, also cut to 'tell,' is held out in the
mechanical shuffling-board. Whilst shuffling the cards,
the dealer causes the holdout to add the 'odd' card to
the pack. Thus there are two kings of diamonds in use.</p>

<p>The cards being put into the dealing-box the game
begins. The dealer keeps his eye upon the needle-tell,
and meanwhile unlocks the mechanism of his box; that
is, if it is made to lock, which is not necessarily the case,
although safer. When the needle indicates the fact that
one of the duplicate cards—in this case a king of diamonds—is
immediately below the top card in the box,
the dealer has to be guided by circumstances. If the
card will win for him, well and good. He deals the
cards as they should be dealt and the king falls to him.
It is evident that it would never do to have two kings of
diamonds turn up in the game, the cue-keeper and cue-cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
would record five kings. So the dealer still watches
the needle, and when he finds that the second king of
diamonds is the top card but one, he exerts the necessary
pressure upon the box to widen the slit. Then, instead
of withdrawing only one card two are passed out together,
and placed as one upon one of the piles. This squares
accounts with the case-keeper.</p>

<p>It may happen, of course, that when the first of the
tell-cards comes to the top it would lose for the dealer.
In that case he would work the 'squeeze,' and deal out
the odd card with the one above it. Then he has to take
his chance with the second of the duplicates, and the
game becomes simply what it would be if honestly
played. The advantage to the dealer resulting from the
employment of the 'odd' is that it provides him with
the means of winning, or at the worst prevents him from
losing on one turn of the deal. This may not seem very
much, but added to the chances of splits turning up it
really means a great deal.</p>

<p>When the dealer is a proficient in sleight-of-hand he
will carefully note the line of play adopted by certain
'fat' players, or, as the unenlightened would say, players
who bet heavily. During the next shuffle he will put up
the cards so as to cause these 'fat' men to lose, and
somewhere about the middle of the pack he will place
the 'odd.' Or it may be he will so arrange matters that
the shuffle and the cut will bring one of the duplicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
cards about a third of the way down the pack and the
other a third of the distance from the other end. Thus
he will have two opportunities of withdrawing two cards
at once, either of which he can use as may suit him
best.</p>

<p>Supposing that hitherto the heaviest betting has been
on the high cards, the dealer will put up the pack in such
a way that only the low ones win for the players. That
is to say, the cards will come out alternately high and low,
the high ones falling to the bank. As the game proceeds
the first of the tell-cards by degrees comes nearer
and nearer the top, and the dealer looks out for the
needle-tell to indicate its approach. By this time, perhaps,
the players may have noticed that the high cards
are losing, and therefore may have altered their play,
betting now upon the low cards. If this is so, the bank
will begin to lose, but not for long. When the tell-card
has become the second from the top the dealer
manipulates the two-card device and draws out two cards
at once. The run of the game is now altered. The
cards still come out alternately high and low, but the high
cards now go to the players. As they have taken to
betting on the low ones they lose in consequence. If,
however, the players show no signs of changing their
mode of betting when the first tell-card nears the top,
the dealer does not alter the run of the cards, but goes
straight on. When he comes to the second duplicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
card he must deal out two at once, or the 'odd' would
be discovered.</p>

<p>The cases given above are put in the simplest form,
for clearness; but it must not be imagined that anyone
investigating a suspected case of cheating would find the
cards arranged to come out always high and low alternately.
The dealer knows better than to risk anything
of that kind. He would be caught directly. The cards
are merely put up in a general sort of way, so as to give
a preponderance in one direction or the other; the dealer
being at liberty to alter the general run of the cards at
either of the two duplicates. Of course he might even
have two extra cards in the pack, these and their duplicates
being tell-cards. That would give him a choice of
two out of four opportunities of altering the run; but
the more devices he employs the greater the chances of
detection. One turn in the deal is plenty. It gives the
dealer all the opportunities he needs; and in the long
run he is bound to win. It is said that in some 'skin'
houses in New York decks of 54, 55, or even 56 cards
are frequently played on soft gamblers.</p>

<p>It is possible for the dealer and players alike to be in
a general conspiracy to cheat the bank. The dealer is
not necessarily the banker. The bank may be found by
anyone; the proprietor of the gambling saloon, for instance.
But a dealer would be very foolish to cheat his
employer. In a private game, if a dupe can be put up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
find the bank in money, that is all right for the sharps.
They are, one and all, at liberty to go in and win—and
they do.</p>

<p>The reader may be interested in knowing that in
America some of the dealers who are employed by proprietors
of gambling houses, or saloons as they are called,
will demand a salary of four or five thousand dollars. It
is said that a very expert dealer is worth that amount per
annum, and that he can get it. It strikes one as being a
somewhat high rate of pay for a man whose sole duty is
to shuffle and deal out cards for a few hours a day, if that
<i>is</i> his sole duty. Suspicious persons—and there are a few
such in the world—might be tempted to believe that
there is more in the dealer's duties than meets the eye,
and a 'darned sight' more. Whatever opinion may be
entertained upon the subject, we can all join, at any rate,
in hoping for the best, and in praying for the <i>bettor</i>.
Though when a man is idiot enough to lose his money,
as some do day after day, in a game where his own common
sense ought to tell him that he stands every chance
of being cheated, he may be looked upon as a hopeless
case. There is nothing that will ever knock intelligence
into him, or his gambling propensities out of him. The
only system of treatment that could be expected to do
him any good would be a lengthened course of strait-waistcoat,
to be repeated with additions upon any sign of
a recurrence of the malady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Two or three years ago an Englishman won 5,000<i>l.</i>
in one year at the Cape, in a sort of rough-and-tumble
game of faro. He ran the bank without either cue-cards
or case-keeper, and also without a dealing-box, as in the
prehistoric times in America before the losses experienced
by those who 'bucked against the tiger' forced these implements
into use. He dealt the cards out of his hand.
The miners played against him for gold-dust and he
nearly always won. His operations were of the most
primitive kind. He simply had a lot of packs of cards,
apparently new, but which had been opened and arranged.
Some were packed for the high cards to win; some for
the low ones. He would take a pack down, give it a
false shuffle and begin to deal it. If he wanted to alter
the run of the cards, he could at any time do so by merely
dropping the top card on the floor. This he did very
cleverly, and nobody noticed it, because the floor was
always littered with used cards. Having no case-keeper
to record the game, the missing cards were never missed.
What about the poor miners? Well, they <i>must</i> have been
flats if their equilibrium remained undisturbed through a
lively game such as that. They deserved to lose all that
the dealer won.</p>

<p>This sharp is now in England 'mug-hunting.' He is
at present acting as bear-leader to a young man who has
just come into 1,700<i>l.</i> a year. He makes most of his living
at 'lumbering' and 'telling the tale,' and his stronghold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
is the bottom deal. The writer has great pleasure in
acknowledging his indebtedness to him for much of the
information as to the methods of the common English
sharp. He is a swindler, but a most agreeable and
gentlemanly one.</p>

<p>This <i>Faro</i> is a hard-hearted monarch whose constant
delight appears to be a slaughter of the innocents;
though one can hardly suppose that his victims are often
the heirs male of Israel. Be that as it may, however,
Faro's victims can hardly hope for succour from a daughter
of Faro, for his only offspring are greed and fraud. And
those who bow the head and bend the knee to Faro are
simply ministering to these two, his children. Those who
waste their substance on Faro are merely forging fetters
for their own limbs, and giving themselves body and soul
to a taskmaster from whose thraldom they will find it
difficult to escape.</p>

<p>To descend from metaphor to matter of fact, there is
no game which gives freer rein to the passion of gambling
than faro. There is no game in which money is lost
and won more readily. Above all, there is no game in
which the opportunities of cheating are more numerous
or more varied. If these are qualities which can recommend
it to a man of common sense, call me a gambler.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>PREPARED CARDS</i></span></h2>

<p>Although, in the course of our previous wanderings
among what may be aptly described as 'The Groves of
Blarney,' we have already encountered many examples of
the various preparations used by the dwellers therein to
add new beauties to their everyday requisites, there still
remain some to be investigated. These philosophers, in
searching for their form of the universal 'alkahest,' which
turns everything they touch to gold, have contrived to
learn many things, besides those we have already looked
into. It behoves us, therefore, to follow in their footsteps
as far as may be; and, before finally quitting the subject
of playing-cards, to complete our information respecting
these beautiful and—to the sharp—useful appliances.</p>

<p>We have seen how much may be accomplished by
means of judicious preparation of the cards. That is not
a discovery which can be ascribed to the present generation
of sinners, or the last, or the one before that. No
man can say when preparation was first 'on the cards.'
Some of the devices contained in this chapter are as old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
as the hills; others are of a more recent date; but, old
or new, this book would be incomplete without some
description of them. The very oldest are sometimes
used even now, in out-of-the-way corners of the world,
and among people who are possessors of that ignorance
of sharping which is not bliss, at least if they happen to
be gamblers.</p>

<p>One of the oldest methods of preparing cards for the
purposes of cheating was by cutting them to various
shapes and sizes. That this plan is still adopted the
reader already knows. We have now to consider the
means whereby the sharp is enabled to alter the form
of the cards in any way he pleases, with neatness and
accuracy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 283px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_239.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="103"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 45.</span>
</div>

<p>The most primitive appliance used for the purpose is
what is now known as a 'stripper-plate.' It consists of
two steel bars, bolted together at each end, the length
between the bolts being ample to allow a playing-card to
be inserted lengthwise between
the bars, and screwed up
tightly. Fig. 45 illustrates a
device of this kind, with a
card <i>in situ</i>, ready for
cutting. Across the centre of the top plate a slight
groove is filed, to facilitate the insertion of the card
in a truly central position. The edges of the two plates
or bars are perfectly smooth, and are formed so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
give the required curve to the card when cut. In the
illustration, the side of the card when cut would become
concave. The cutting is managed by simply running a
sharp knife or razor along the side of the arrangement.
This takes off a thin shred of the card, and, guided by
the steel plates, the cut is clean and the edge of the
card is in no danger of becoming jagged.</p>

<p>The most modern appliance of this kind, however,
will be found quoted in one of the catalogues under the
name of 'trimming-shears.' These shears are not
necessarily cheating-tools; they are largely used to trim
the edges of faro-cards, which will not pass through the
dealing-box if they are damaged. The shears for cleaning
up cards in a genuine manner, however, are only
required to cut them rectangularly. In the case of those
used for swindling they must cut at any desired angle.</p>

<p>These shears consist of an oblong block of wood,
into which a steel bar is sunk along one edge, carrying a
bracket which supports the cutting-blade, working on a
pivot at one end (fig. 46). The edge of the steel bar
and the blade which works in close contact with it form
respectively the lower and upper halves of the shears.
Upon the upper surface of the wooden block two guide-plates
are fixed, by means of thumb-screws. These
plates are adjustable to any angle within certain limits,
and are for the purpose of holding the cards in position
whilst being cut. The guide-plates being set at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
necessary angle, the card about to be cut is pressed
against them with the left hand, whilst the right brings
down the knife, and cuts off one edge. Fig. 46 shows a
card in the act of being cut. Each card being held
against the guides while cutting, uniformity of the whole
is secured. When one side of each card has had a shaving
taken off, if it is desired to trim the opposite side as
well, the guides are adjusted to give the required width,
and a second cut is taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_241.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="258"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 46.</span>
</div>

<p>Shears of this kind, of course, will not cut the sides of
the cards concave; but a very good substitute for convex
sides may be made by taking two cuts on each side, at
a very slight angle one to the other, taking more off the
corners than in the centre. There is no need to impress
upon the reader that the defective form of the card is not
made sufficiently pronounced to be noticeable. The
two cuts do not meet in the middle to form a point; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
apex of the angle, so to speak, is cut off, leaving the
central portion of the side flat, and square with the ends
of the card.</p>

<p>Square-cornered playing-cards of course will show no
signs of having been trimmed in this way; but those
with round corners are bound to do so, however slight a
shaving may have been removed from the side. In
trimming these for cheating, therefore, the sharp has to
employ, in addition to the shears, what is called a 'round-corner
cutter.' This is an instrument which restores the
circular form of the corners, which otherwise would
show the point at which the shears cut through them.
It is simply a sort of punch, which cuts the corners, one
at a time, into their original shape, and gives them their
proper curve.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the tools. We have next to
consider the various forms given to the cards, and the
uses to which they are put when thus prepared.</p>

<p>The simplest device connected with cards which
have been trimmed is that known as the 'large card.'
As its name implies, it is a card which is left slightly
larger than the rest of the pack. All the others are
trimmed down, either slightly narrower or shorter, or
smaller altogether. This is a very primitive dodge, and
one seldom resorted to, in the ordinary way, nowadays.
Its object is to give the sharp either a ready means of
forcing the cut at a given point in the pack, or of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the pass at that point, if the cut does not happen to be
made in the right place. The cards being manipulated
so as to arrange them according to some particular system,
the large card is placed at the bottom, and then the pack
is divided at about the middle, and the top half put
underneath. The pack is straightened, and laid on the
table to be cut. Not suspecting any trickery, it is almost
certain that the dupe, in cutting, will seize hold of the
large card, which is now in the centre of the pack, and
cut at that point. This brings the cards again into the
positions they occupied relatively at first. If the cut,
however, should not happen to be made at the 'large,'
the sharp has to make the pass, and bring that card
once more to the bottom. No modern sharp of any
standing would use such a palpable fraud, even among
the most innocent of his dupes. It is a long way behind
the times, and was out of date years ago.</p>

<p>Another form of card which at one time was largely
used, but which has become too well-known to be of
much service, is the 'wedge.' Wedges are cards which
have been cut narrower at one end than the other, the
two long sides inclining towards each other at a slight
angle. The cards when cut in this way, and packed
with all the broad ends looking the same way, cannot be
distinguished from those which are perfectly square; but
when some are placed one way and some the other, there
is no difficulty in telling 'which is which.' Before these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
cards became commonly known, they must have proved
very useful to the sharp. If he wished to force the cut
at any particular place, he had only to place the two
halves of the pack in opposite directions, and the cut
was pretty sure to be made at the right point. If he
wished to distinguish the court cards from the others, all
he had to do was to turn them round in the pack, so
that their broad ends faced the other way. If he wished
to be sure of making the pass at any card, by just turning
the wide end of that card to the narrow ends of the
others he could always feel where it was, without
looking at it. In fact, the utility of such cards was
immense, but it has long been among the things that
were. Now, the first thing a tiro in sleight-of-hand will
do, on being asked to examine a pack of cards, is to cut
them and turn the halves end for end, to see if they are
'wedges.' Needless to say, they never are.</p>

<p>The only case in which it is at all possible to use
cards of this kind at the present day is in a very, very
'soft' game of faro, where the players do not ask
permission to examine the pack. The dealer has the
sole right of shuffling and cutting the cards; therefore
if he has the opportunity of using wedges, nothing is
easier than to have all the high cards put one way, and
the low ones the other. Then in shuffling he can put
up the high cards to lose or win, and, in fact, arrange
the pack in any manner he likes. There is very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
safety, however, in the use of wedges at any time.
Practical men would laugh at the idea of employing
them.</p>

<p>The concave and convex cards cut by means of the
stripper-plates, described earlier in this chapter, are still
in use to a limited extent. The common English
sharp employs them in connection with a game called
'Banker.' He 'readies up the broads,' as he terms it,
by cutting all the high cards convex, and the low ones
concave. There is also another game known as 'Black
and Red,' in which the cards of one colour are convex,
and the other colour concave.</p>

<p>The most commonly used form of cards, however, is
that of the 'double-wedges' or 'strippers,' cut by means
of the trimming-shears, and which have been already
described. The name of 'strippers' is derived from
the operation which these cards are principally intended
to facilitate, and which consists of drawing off from the
pack, or 'stripping,' certain cards which are required
for use in putting up hands. Suppose the sharp is
playing a game of poker, and, naturally, he wishes to
put up the aces for himself, or for a confederate. He
cuts the aces narrow at each end, and all the other cards
of the same width as the ends of the aces. This leaves
the sides of the aces bulging out slightly from the sides
of the pack, and enables him to draw them all out with
one sweep of his fingers during the shuffle. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
are placed all together, at the bottom of the pack, and
can be put up for deal or draft, or they may be held out
until required.</p>

<p>'End-strippers' are a variety of the same kind of
thing, the only difference being that they are trimmed up
at the ends, instead of at the sides.</p>

<p>It is only in England and other countries where the
spread of knowledge in this direction has been limited
to the sharps themselves, the general public remaining in
ignorance, that strippers are employed. They would be
instantly detected among people who have learnt anything
at all of sharping.</p>

<p>Trimming is not the only method of preparing cards
for cheating purposes; there are others of much greater
delicacy and refinement. Witness the following, which is
culled from the circular issued by one of the 'Sporting
Houses':—</p>

<p>'<i>To smart poker players.</i>—I have invented a process
by which a man is sure of winning if he can introduce
his own cards. The cards are not trimmed or marked in
any way, shape or manner. They can be handled and
shuffled by all at the board, and without looking at a card
you can, by making two or three shuffles or ripping them
in, oblige the dealer to give three of a kind to any one
playing, or the same advantage can be taken on your own
deal. This is a big thing for any game. In euchre you
can hold the joker every time or the cards most wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in any game. The process is hard to detect, as the
cards look perfectly natural, and it is something card-players
are not looking for. Other dealers have been
selling sanded cards, or cheap cards, with spermacetia
rubbed on, and calling them professional playing or
magnetic cards. I don't want you to class my cards with
that kind of trash. I use a liquid preparation put on with
rollers on all cards made; this dries on the cards and
does not show, and will last as long as the cards do. The
object is to make certain cards not prepared slip off
easier than others in shuffling. You can part or break
the deck to an ace or king, and easily "put up three," no
matter where they lay in the deck. This advantage
works fine single-handed, or when the left-hand man
shuffles and offers the cards to be cut. These cards are
ten times better than readers or strippers, and they get
the money faster. Price, $2,00 per pack by mail;
$20,00 per dozen packs. If you order a dozen I will
furnish cards like you use.'</p>

<p>The gentle modesty and unassuming candour of the
above effusion, its honest rectitude and perfect self-abnegation,
render it a very pearl of literature. It is a
pity that such a jewel should be left to hide itself away,
and waste its glories upon the unappreciative few, whilst
thousands might be gladdened by the sight of it and proceed
on their way invigorated and refreshed. Let us
bring it into the light and treasure it as it deserves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
As the talented author above quoted suggests, there
are several methods of achieving the object set forth,
and causing the cards to slip at any desired place, apart
from the much vaunted 'liquid preparation put on with
rollers' the secret of which one would think that he
alone possessed. We will just glance at them all, by
way of improving our minds and learning all that is to be
learnt.</p>

<p>The earliest method of preparing a pack of cards in
this way certainly had the merit of extreme simplicity, in
that it consisted of nothing more than putting the pack,
for some time previous to its use, in a damp place. This
system had the further advantage that it was not even
necessary to open the wrapper in which the cards came
from the maker. When the cards had absorbed a certain
amount of moisture, it was found that the low cards
would slip much more easily than the court cards. The
reason for this was, that the glaze used in 'bringing up
the colours' of the inks used in printing contained a
large proportion of hygroscopic or gummy matter, which
softened more or less upon becoming moist. The court
cards, having a much greater part of their faces covered
with the glaze than the others, were more inclined to cling
to the next card, in consequence. Therefore the task of
distinguishing them was by no means severe.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with this somewhat uncertain method,
however, the sharps set to work to improve upon it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
next departure was in the direction of making the smooth
cards smoother, and the rough ones more tenacious. The
upshot of this was that those cards which were required
to slip were lightly rubbed over with soap, and those
which had to cling were treated with a faint application
of rosin. This principle has been the basis of all the
'new and improved' systems that have been put before
the sharping public ever since. Either something is done
to the cards to make them slip, or they are prepared with
something to keep them from slipping.</p>

<p>When the unglazed 'steam-boat' cards were much in
use the 'spermacetia' system, referred to in the paragraph
quoted a little while ago, was a very pretty thing indeed,
and worked well. The cards which it was necessary to
distinguish from the others were prepared by rubbing
their backs well with hard spermaceti wax. They were
then vigorously scoured with some soft material, until
they had acquired a brilliant polish. Cards treated in
this manner, when returned again to the pack, would be
readily separable from the others. By pressing rather
heavily upon the top of the pack, and directing the
pressure slightly to one side, it would be found that the
pack divided at one of the prepared cards. That is to
say, the cards above the prepared one would cling
together and slide off, leaving the doctored one at the
top of the remainder.</p>

<p>With glazed cards, if they are required to slip, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
backs are rubbed with a piece of waxed tissue paper, thus
giving them an extra polish; but the better plan is to
slightly roughen the backs of all the others. They
may be 'sanded,' as in the case of those used for the
sand-tell faro-box. This simply means that the backs
are rubbed with sand-paper. In reality, it is fine emery-paper
that is used; any sand-paper would be too coarse,
and produce scratches.</p>

<p>There still remains to be considered the method of
causing the cards to cling, by the application of that
marvellous master-stroke of inventive genius, the 'liquid
preparation,' as advertised. It may be hoped that the
reader will not feel disappointed on learning what it is.
The wonderful compound is nothing more or less than
very thin white hard varnish. That is all. It may be
applied 'with rollers,' or otherwise, just as the person
applying it may prefer. The fact of certain cards being
treated with this varnish renders them somewhat 'tacky,'
and inclined to stick together; not sufficiently, however, to
render the effect noticeable to anyone who is not looking
for it. But, by manipulating the pack as before directed
in the case of the waxed cards, the slipping will occur at
those cards whose backs have not been varnished. The
instructions sent out with the cards mentioned in the
advertisement will be found reprinted at p. 304; therefore,
since it would be presumptuous to think of adding
anything to advice emanating from the great authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
himself, we may leave him to describe the use of his
own wares.</p>

<p>Having thus said all that is necessary to give the
reader sufficient information for his guidance in any case
of sharping with which he may be brought into contact,
we may bring this chapter to a close; and, in so doing,
conclude all that has to be said upon the subject of
cheating at cards. We have been compelled to dwell
somewhat at length upon matters which are associated
with cards and card-games only, because so large a proportion
of the sharping which goes on in the world is card-sharping.
Almost everyone plays cards, and so many
play for money. Therefore, the sharp naturally selects
that field which affords him the widest scope and the
most frequent opportunities for the exercise of his calling.
Card-sharping has been reduced to a science. It is no
longer a haphazard affair, involving merely primitive
manipulations, but it has developed into a profession in
which there is as much to learn as in most of the everyday
occupations of ordinary mortals.</p>

<p>With this chapter, then, we take a fond farewell of
cards, for the present; and having said 'adieu,' we will
turn our attention to other matters.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>DICE</i></span></h2>

<p>With this chapter we strike out into fresh territory. We
have passed through the land of those who trust their
fortunes to the turn of the card, and arrive now among
the aborigines, whose custom is to stake their worldly
possessions upon the hazard of the die. As to which
custom is the more commendable of the two, it is somewhat
difficult to decide. They are both 'more honoured
in the breach than the observance.' Readily, as we have
seen, the innocent pieces of pasteboard are made to serve
the purposes of cheating; and no less readily are the
tiny cubes of ivory or celluloid falsified, and made the
instruments of dishonesty.</p>

<p>This of course is no secret. The name of 'loaded
dice' is familiar to all; but it is the name alone which is
familiar; the things themselves are, to the vast majority of
mankind, absolutely unknown. In some respects it is
quite as well that it should be so; but it is far better that
these things should be generally understood, and that the
signs and tokens of their existence and their employment
should be known to all. In this chapter then, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
deal with the subject in its entirety, describing the different
systems of cheating, and some of the so-called games to
which these methods are applied.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, cheating at dice maybe classed under
two heads—the manipulation of genuine dice, and the
employment of unfair ones. From this it will be gathered
that the 'loaded dice,' so often spoken of, are by no means
necessary to the sharp who has made this line of business
his speciality. Loaded dice, in fact, are very puerile contrivances,
compared with some of the devices which are
about to be brought to the reader's notice. They are one
of the landmarks of cheating, it is true; but they are not
the high-watermark, by any means. The modern sharp
has to a great extent risen above them, although they are
still useful to him at times. They have one very great
defect—they will not 'spin' properly; and that militates
very greatly against their use, in circles where the players
are at all 'fly.'</p>

<p>We will first devote our attention to the means of
cheating with fair dice; and the reader will learn that the
thing which may have appeared to him as being difficult
of accomplishment is really a very simple matter indeed.
This branch of the art is known to its professors as
'securing,' and consists of a plan of retaining certain
dice. One is held against the inside edge of the box, whilst
the other is allowed to fall freely into it. In this way one
of the dice is not shaken at all, and falls on the table in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the same position as it previously occupied. In order that
this may be accomplished satisfactorily, it is necessary
to use a suitable dice-box; therefore, we will inspect one
of the kind generally used by professional dice-players
in this country. Before proceeding further, however, it
may be as well to inform the reader that the information
here given, with regard to dice and their manipulation, has
been had upon the authority of one of the leading English
sharps, and may be said to fairly represent the present
state of the science.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 107px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_254.jpg" alt="" width="107" height="170"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 47.</span>
</div>

<p>The dice-box referred to above is illustrated in section
in fig. 47. It is simply the usual form, with the interior
corrugated to insure the thorough turning about of the
dice. The only preparation in connection with it is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the flat inside rim or lip, marked 'A' in the figure, is
roughened by rubbing it with coarse glass-paper. This
gives it a kind of 'tooth,' which prevents the dice from
slipping when they are 'secured' against it.</p>

<p>A box of this kind being to hand, nothing further in
the way of apparatus is required for the operation of
securing. All else depends entirely upon practice. As
the dice are taken from the table one of them is
secured, and the others are thrown into the box. An
expert will use three dice, securing one and letting the
others go, but it requires some skill to pick up three dice
in the proper manner and without fear of dropping them
all. Therefore a novice will use only two. The process
is carried out as follows:—</p>

<p>The dice are laid upon the table side by side. The
one farthest from the operator is placed with the ace
uppermost, consequently the six is upon the face which
lies on the table. This is the die which is about to be
secured. The first two fingers of the right hand are
now laid flat upon the dice, and between these two fingers
the dice are taken up by their right-hand edges.</p>

<p>Thus:—</p>

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 48.</span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
They are now pushed well home by the thumb:—</p>

  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 49.</span>
</div>

<p>The die nearest the operator is now allowed to fall
into the dice-box, whilst the other is retained:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 230px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_256b.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="432"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 50.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
The box is next taken in the right hand, the fingers
lying flat over the mouth of it, and the thumb holding it
at the bottom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 253px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_257a.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="173"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 51.</span>
</div>

<p>In the act of closing the fingers of the right hand over
the box, the die which has been retained is firmly pressed
between the second finger and the inside edge of the
box. In this position it is completely hidden by the
forefinger, and is there held whilst the box is shaken. If
the forefinger were raised the die would appear situated
in this manner:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_257b.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="150"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 52.</span>
</div>

<p>The sharp, however, is particularly careful <i>not</i> to
raise his forefinger; that is not 'in the piece' at all. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
box is now shaken, and of course the die which is not
secured is heard to rattle within it. Finally, the hand
is turned round so that the mouth of the box is downwards
and the backs of the fingers rest upon the
table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 286px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_258.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="171"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 53.</span>
</div>

<p>After the box has thus been turned upside down, then
comes the crucial point of the whole operation. If the
fingers are not carefully removed the secured die will
not fall upon the face intended. The proper method of
'boxing' the dice upon the table is to remove the fingers
in the following order. Firstly, the second and third
fingers are opened, allowing the loose die to fall upon the
table. Then the first and second fingers are gently
opened, easing the secured die, as it were, into its position
of rest. Lastly, the forefinger is moved to the edge
of the box, at the same time withdrawing the second
finger entirely, and the box is let down over the two dice.
It is immediately lifted up and the score is recorded.
There is nothing at all suspicious in any of these movements;
they are quite the usual thing, or appear so when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
quickly performed, the only difference between the
genuine shake and the false being the retention of the
one die. Of course, it is necessary that the entire operation
should occupy the least possible time, the hands
being kept somewhat low and the dupe seated upon the
right-hand side of the operator.</p>

<p>The secured die naturally falls with the six uppermost,
whilst the loose one cannot show less than one. Therefore
the sharp cannot throw less than seven with two dice. That
is the lowest score possible for him to make, whilst the dupe
may throw only 'two.' Now, in an infinite number of throws
with two dice 'seven' is the number of pips which will be
the average for each throw. Sometimes, of course, only
two pips will be thrown; sometimes both sixes will come
uppermost, making twelve pips together. But with one
die secured in such a manner as to fall six, the average of
an infinite number of throws is necessarily very much
increased, because it is impossible to throw less than
seven. The chances of the two players bear no comparison,
and the dupe is bound to be beaten. For instance,
the chances of throwing twelve by the player who
secures one die are as one to six—that is to say, they are
six to one against him, whilst the chances against the
player who goes to work fairly are <i>thirty-five to one</i>.
This will serve to give the reader some idea of the value
of one secured die out of two in use.</p>

<p>Passing on to the use of unfair dice, we find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
there are three kinds employed at the present day.
Firstly, there are those whose faces do not bear the
correct number of pips, and which are known as
'dispatchers.' Secondly, we have those which are
weighted at one side, and tend to fall with that side
downwards, such being the well-known 'loaded dice.'
Lastly, there is the variety bearing the name of
'electric dice,' which are the most modern development
in this department of cheating. We will take the
varieties seriatim.</p>

<p>1. <i>Dispatchers.</i>—These are of two kinds, called 'high'
and 'low' respectively, in accordance with the fact of
their having an aggregate of pips either higher or lower
than should be the case. They owe their origin to the
fact that it is impossible to see more than three sides of
a cube at one time. In making a high dispatcher, then,
any three adjacent sides are taken and marked with two,
four, and six pips respectively. That side of the cube
which is immediately opposite to the one with six pips,
instead of being marked with one, as it should be, is
marked six also. The side opposite the four is marked
four, and that opposite the two is marked two in a
similar manner. Therefore, no two sides which bear
the same number of pips are ever seen at one time, the
duplicate marks being always on opposite sides of the
die. In a low dispatcher the process is precisely the
same, but the sides are numbered with one, two and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
three pips, instead of two, four, and six. It is evident,
then, that a high dispatcher cannot throw less than two,
whilst a low one cannot throw higher than three.
Therefore, if the sharp throws with one genuine die and
one high dispatcher, he cannot throw less than three,
and the chances are 17·5 to 1 against his throwing
anything so low. If, in addition to using a high
dispatcher himself, he gives his dupe a low one<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and a
genuine die to use, the throw of the two dice cannot be
higher than nine, and the chances are 17·5 to 1 against
its being so high. In fact, in an infinite number of
throws, the sharp will average over thirty per cent. better
than his opponent. This being the case it is obvious
that the game can only go in one way, and that way is
not the dupe's.</p>

<p>2. <i>Loaded dice.</i>—These commodities are found to be
thus described in one of the price-lists:—</p>

<p>'<i>Loaded dice.</i>—Made of selected ivory loaded with
quicksilver, and can be shaken from the box so as to
come high or low, as you wish. With a set of these you
will find yourself winner at all dice games, and carry off
the prize at every raffle you attend. Sold in sets of
nine dice, three high, three low, and three fair. Price
per set, complete, $5.00.'</p>

<p>These are the most superior kind of loaded dice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
They are made by drilling out two adjacent spots or pips
at one edge of the die, filling in the cavity with mercury,
and cementing it up fast. The commoner description
of these things are made by filling the holes with lead
instead of mercury.</p>

<p>As before mentioned, these dice have the disadvantage
that they will not spin upon one corner as
genuine ones will; consequently a person who suspects
that they are being used can easily discover the fact, if
he is knowing enough to try them. This defect led to
the invention of the third kind of false dice, which we
are about to investigate.</p>

<p>3. <i>Electric dice.</i>—These will be found quoted in one
of the catalogues, together with the special tables to be
used with them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 310px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_262.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="166"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 54.</span>
</div>

<p>The dice themselves are made of celluloid, and their
construction will be readily understood with the aid of
the illustration given at
fig. 54. The first operation
in making dice of this kind
is to bore out a cylindrical
cavity almost completely
through the die, the mouth
of this cavity being situated
upon the face of the die which will bear the six pips, and
the bottom almost reaching to the opposite face, upon
which is the ace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
At the bottom of the cavity, and consequently
immediately within the die above the single pip or ace,
is put a thin circular disc of iron. The greater part of
the cavity is then filled in with cork, leaving sufficient
depth for the insertion of a plug, which effectually closes
up the aperture, and upon the outer side of which are
marked the six pips appertaining to that face of the die.
Before this plug is fastened into its place, however, a
small pellet of lead, of exactly the same weight as the
iron disc, is pressed into the upper surface of the cork,
and there fixed. Finally, the plug bearing the six pips
is cemented into its place, and the die is complete.
Apparently, this plug is cemented in with celluloid, the
same material as that used in fabricating the die itself,
and the joint is so well and neatly made that it is
invisible, even though examined with a powerful lens.</p>

<p>The <i>rationale</i> of this construction is as follows. The
iron disc and the leaden pellet, being immediately within
opposite faces of the die, will exactly balance each other,
and thus the die can be spun or thrown in exactly the
same manner as a genuine one. The lead and iron,
however, being so much heavier than the material of
which the body of the die is supposed to consist, would
cause the weight of the die to be very suspicious, were it
not for the fact that the interior is almost entirely
composed of a still lighter material—cork. Therefore,
the completed die is no heavier than a genuine one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the same size and appearance. In fact, these dice will
bear the strictest examination, in every way—except one,
viz. the application of a magnet.</p>

<p>The word magnet gives the key to the employment
of these so-called electric dice. The technical reader
will at once grasp the idea thus embodied, and will need
no further description of the details of working. For the
benefit of those who are unacquainted with electricity
and its phenomena, however, it is necessary to explain
the nature of an electro-magnet. If a bar of soft iron is
surrounded by a helix of insulated copper wire, and a
current of electricity is passed through that wire, the iron
instantly becomes converted into a magnet for the time
being. But directly the contact at one end of the wire
is broken, and the current is for that reason no longer
permitted to flow, the iron loses its magnetism and
resumes its normal condition. If, therefore, a bar of
this kind is connected with a battery in such a way that
the current can be controlled by means of a push,
similar to those used in connection with electric bells,
the otherwise inert bar of iron can be converted into a
magnet at any instant, and allowed to resume its former
state at will.</p>

<p>Now, the table with which these electric dice are
used is so constructed that, immediately below its surface
and within the thickness of the wood itself, there
are concealed several electro-magnets such as have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
described. At some convenient spot in the table, at the
back of a drawer or elsewhere, the battery supplying
the current is hidden. The key or push controlling the
current takes the form of a secret spring in the table-leg,
so placed as to be within easy access of the operator's
knee.</p>

<p>The result, then, is obvious. Among the dice in use
are one or more of the 'electric' variety. When the
dupe throws them, he has to take his chance as to how
they will fall, and as long as the sharp is winning he will
do the same. <i>But</i> directly he begins to lose, or to find
that he is not winning fast enough to please him, the
sharp presses the secret spring with his knee when it is
his turn to throw, and—click!—the false dice turn up
'sixes.' The magnets, of course, attract the iron discs,
drawing them on to the table, and the sixes being upon
the opposite sides of the dice naturally fall uppermost.
The operator has only to trouble himself with regard to
two points—he must press the spring at the right
moment, and release it before trying to pick up the dice
afterwards. Should he neglect this latter point, he will
have the satisfaction of finding the dice stick to the
table. In all other respects, he has only to 'press the
button,' and electricity will 'do the rest.'</p>

<p>The publication of this book, however, will once and
for all render the use of electric dice unsafe under
any conditions. The moment the outer world has any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
idea of their existence, the game is too risky to be pleasant
to any sharp. A little mariner's compass, dangling at
the end of a stranger's watch chain, or carried secretly,
will serve to reveal in an instant the true nature of the
deception which is being practised upon him by his host.
It is sad that the diffusion of knowledge should be
accompanied by such untoward consequences; but we
can hardly hope that the sharps will die of disappointment
or despair, even though dice were undoubtedly
doomed to detection and disaster, and had dwindled
into disuse. (Alliteration is the curse of modern literature.)</p>

<p>Unfair dice are seldom submitted for inspection, as
may well be imagined, particularly those of the dispatcher
kind. The greatest donkey in existence would at once
find that the number of pips upon the faces of these latter
was incorrect. Therefore they are always introduced
into the game whilst the play is occupying the dupe's
undivided attention, and the manner of their introduction
is that embodied in the process known as 'ringing-in.'
This is done at the moment when the dice are taken
up in order to throw them into the box. It is only
possible to change one die, the others are allowed to
fall into the box in the usual way.</p>

<p>Supposing that two dice are being used, two fair ones
will be employed, and with these the dupe will throw.
The sharp, however, has a false die concealed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
right hand, and held in the thumb joint. He picks up
the two fair dice from the table, in the manner described
in 'securing,' and allows one of them to fall into the box.
Then, of course, he has still two dice in his hand, one
genuine one between his fingers, and one false one held
by his thumb. In figs. 55 and 56, <i>a</i> is the genuine die
and <i>b</i> is the false one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_267a.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="176"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 55.</span>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 304px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_267b.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="252"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 56.</span>
</div>

<p>At the same instant that the first die is allowed to
fall, the false die <i>b</i> is dropped into the box also (fig. 56).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 230px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_268.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="136"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 57.</span>
</div>

<p>Immediately the false die is released the two fingers
holding the second genuine one are turned inwards
(fig. 57), and the die is taken into the thumb-joint, in
the position formerly occupied by the false one. The
whole of this manipulation
is performed in the act of
throwing the dice into the
box. The false die is dropped
into the box, and the genuine
one put into its place at
the root of the thumb in
one movement only, and the exchange is instantaneous.
The fingers are well bent before any of the dice are
dropped, so that the second genuine die has the least
possible distance to travel in its movement towards the
thumb-joint.</p>

<p>From the manipulations outlined above, the reader
will observe that the skill required is less in the case of
dice than in that of cards; but he must not run away
with the idea that, because the methods of swindling
with dice are comparatively simple, the dice-sharp
requires but little practice to enable him to carry out his
operations successfully. That is by no means the case.
It is frequently the amateur's lot to find that those things
which appear simplest in theory are the most difficult in
practice. The sharp who seeks his fortune by manipulation
of the 'ivories' has to devote many weary hours to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the acquisition of deftness in the manœuvres which he
intends to employ.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to consider the application of
the foregoing principles to the purposes of cheating, and
see how they are employed in actual practice. In this
we cannot do better than follow the sharp's operations
in connection with one or two games which are commonly
played. This will serve to give the reader a more
adequate conception of the manner in which this style of
cheating is conducted. The games selected for this
purpose, then, are: 'Over and under seven,' 'Yankee-grab'
or 'Newmarket,' 'Sweat,' and 'Hazard.'</p>

<p><i>Over and under seven.</i>—This is a game which is played
with a 'layout,' or painted cloth, upon which the players
place their stakes. The form most generally used is
divided in the following manner:—</p>

<table class="box" style="padding: 0;" summary="Fig. 58." cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">3 to 1</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="br" align="center">Under</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">Over</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">against</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="br" align="center">SEVEN</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">SEVEN</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">SEVEN</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p class="p0 caption smcap">Fig. 58.</p>

<p>The players having placed their stakes upon either of
the three divisions they may individually choose, the
'banker' shakes two dice in the box and throws them out
upon the table. If the throw proves to be over seven,
those players who have put their money upon 'over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
seven' in the layout receive the amount of their stakes,
whilst those who have bet upon the other squares will
lose to the banker. In the same way, if the throw is
under seven the players who have backed 'under seven'
will win. If, however, the throw should prove to be
exactly seven, those players who have staked upon the
centre square of the layout will receive three times the
amount of their stakes. A little reflection will show that
even in a fair game, if players can be found to back the
'3 to 1 against seven' square, the bank has a large
percentage of the chances of the game in its favour.
Indeed, in an infinite number of throws, the banker
stands to win two-fifths of all the money staked upon the
centre square. The chances against seven turning up are
really 5 to 1, and not 3 to 1.</p>

<p>Cheating at this game may be done either by the
banker or the players, although at first sight it would
appear that the players can have no opportunities for
cheating the bank as they have nothing to do with handling
the dice. When the bank cheats the players the
methods employed are as follows. The banker notes the
disposition of the bets upon the layout and reckons up
the amounts upon the various squares. His policy, of
course, is to let that square win which has the least
staked upon it. If he can always do this his gains must
obviously be always greater than his losses. If the
'under seven' division has the least stakes he will secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
one of the dice to fall with the ace uppermost. Then
the throw must prove to be either seven or under. If
the division of the layout which has least money on it is
the 'over seven,' a die is secured in such a manner as to
fall with the six uppermost, and in this case the throw must
be either seven or over. If the bets upon both 'under'
and 'over' squares are equal he has no need to trouble,
as he can neither win nor lose with those squares. If
either of them turns up, the money simply passes across
the table from one side to the other, whilst the bank takes
whatever may have been staked upon the centre square.
Even though the players always staked an amount which
should equalise the bets upon the 'over' and 'under'
divisions, they would lose to the bank one fifth of their
stakes in the long run because the seven would turn
up on the average once in six times, and then those two
divisions would both lose.</p>

<p>The banker always shakes the box quietly, so as not
to give any indication of the fact that only one die is
rattling about within it. At the same time he keeps up
a running fire of remarks such as, 'Any more?' 'Over
wins!' 'Under pays the over,' 'The little seven wins!'
&amp;c. This is the approvedly professional way of conducting
the game, all others are spurious imitations, and
cannot be recognised by true 'sports.'</p>

<p>Another method of cheating the players is to ring
in a loaded die which will fall six. If the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
betting is found to be over seven, this die is secured so
that it shall fall ace uppermost, and then the throw can
only be seven or under. If on the other hand the
highest betting is 'under seven,' the dice are simply
shaken without securing, and the result must be seven or
over. If there is heavy betting upon the 'seven' or
central division of the layout a two or a three is secured
upon the genuine die, and this will make the throw
necessarily over seven. As a rule, however, the central
or '3 to 1 against' square does not require much
attention from the sharp. The chances are always
five to three in his favour. If the players persistently
bet upon the high square of the layout, the sharp will
just ring in a loaded die that falls with the ace up, to
save himself trouble. When this is done, the throw can
manifestly never be <i>over</i> seven.</p>

<p>In cases where the players cheat the bank, it
generally happens that the banker is not a professional,
but a novice who has been put up or persuaded to
accept the position for the time being. A party of
sharps will always get a 'mug' to take the bank if they
can. Securing, in an instance of this kind, is impossible;
the cheating must be done by contriving to introduce
into the game either a dispatcher or a loaded die. The
latter is the safer thing to do, because a dispatcher will
not bear even a moment's attentive examination. The
ringing-in is done by officiously picking up the dice for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the next throw, tossing them carelessly into the box, and
handing the whole over to the banker. If well done,
the exchange is imperceptible, and it is highly improbable
that it will be noticed. The bets, of course, will be
made according to the nature of the die which has been
rung in. If it is made to fall high, the bets are put upon
the 'over seven' division; if it falls low, they are put
on 'under seven.' Naturally, the players allow the bank
to win occasionally, in order to avoid suspicion. Finally,
and before quitting the game, a genuine die is rung in,
replacing the false one. There are not many chances
in favour of the bank with this method of playing.</p>

<p><i>Yankee-grab or Newmarket.</i>—This game is played with
three dice, and the object in view is to get nearest to an
aggregate of eighteen pips; or in the English Colonies,
where the 'ace' or single pip counts seven, to throw the
nearest to twenty-one. Each player has three throws. At
the first throw he picks out the highest number thrown,
and puts that die aside. Then he throws with the two
remaining dice, puts aside the higher as before, and throws
again with the remaining one. The number thrown this
last time, together with the numbers shown by the dice
which have been put aside from the two former throws,
will constitute that player's score. This is done by all the
players in rotation, and the highest score wins all the
stakes. Any player may, however, elect to throw with one
die only for each throw if he chooses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Cheating at this game is obviously easy. It may be
done either by securing, by the use of loaded dice, or by
ringing in dispatchers. It is of course necessary to have
some means of distinguishing the dispatchers from the
fair dice if the cheating is done by those means. In
picking up the dice from the table, the sharp whose turn
it is to throw will change one of them for a high dispatcher.
When the throw is made, the false die is very
likely to be the highest; but if it is not, so much the
better for the sharp, as he has it available for the next
throw. Supposing it to be the highest, he will apparently
toss it carelessly aside, but in reality, he changes it again
for the genuine die which has meanwhile been held in his
thumb-joint. The genuine die is turned over to show
the same value as that given by the dispatcher in the throw.
The other players will not mind the careless handling of
the die, as the value has already been called; the only
object in putting the dice on one side being to act as
markers, and prevent any dispute as to the value of the
previous throws. The same thing is done in the succeeding
throws; the dispatcher going into the box all three times.
At the conclusion of the throws, the false die is exchanged
for the genuine one it has replaced for the time being.</p>

<p>If the sharp prefers to use securing instead of false
dice, he may secure a six upon one die at each of the
first two throws; but the third throw must be left to
chance. If the last die were to be secured, there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
be none left to rattle in the box. A case has been known
where a man even secured the last die; but he had an
arrangement sewn into his coat-sleeve, to counterfeit the
noise made by the die in the box.</p>

<p>In using loaded dice at Yankee-grab, the best plan is to
have three which will all fall 'sixes.' In order to avoid the
suspicion which must inevitably be created by the fact of
the three dice turning up six each at the first throw, a low
number is secured upon one of them in the first and
second throws. This puts the other players off the scent,
at the same time insuring three sixes for the sharp. This
is a very ingenious expedient.</p>

<p>A good way of finishing a game, where the sharp has
been securing and where the dupe has had ample opportunities
of assuring himself that only fair dice are being
used, is for the sharp to palm a dispatcher in the right
hand, and deliver himself thus:—'My dear fellow, you
have lost a lot.' (Here he pats the dupe on the shoulder
with the hand which has the dispatcher palmed within it.)
'I will tell you what I will do. I will go double or quits
with you, on three throws each, with one die.' The dupe
usually jumps at the chance of thus winning back what
he has lost; the sharp rings in his dispatcher, and of
course the 'mug' loses.</p>

<p>In using a dispatcher the sharp always puts the box down
with the left hand; this leaves his right hand free to ring
the changes. Whatever manipulation he may be engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
upon, he does everything slowly, easily, and deliberately.
When tossing the selected die on one side after a throw
and ringing in a square one to replace the loaded die
or dispatcher, he takes care of course to turn it with the
same side up that the other fell. This prevents any dispute
as to the score, when all three throws have been made.
At all times he gauges the mental calibre of his dupe, and
operates in the manner which is most likely to be successful.
Above all, he never neglects the golden rule of
his profession—'Always work on the square as long as
you are winning.'</p>

<p><i>Sweat.</i>—This is a game which is almost as charmingly
artistic as its name, and one which is particularly lovely
for the banker. It also has the merit of extreme simplicity,
and although cheating is hardly necessary as a rule, still
there are times when it may be resorted to with great
profit to the sharp. It is played with a layout arranged
in the following manner:—</p>

<table class="box" style="padding: 0;" summary="Fig. 59." cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" border="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="br bb" align="center">1</td>
    <td class="br bb" align="center">2</td>
    <td class="bb" align="center">3</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="br" align="center">4</td>
    <td class="br" align="center">5</td>
    <td align="center">6</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p class="p0 caption smcap">Fig. 59.</p>

<p>The banker shakes up three dice in the box, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
numbers thrown win for the players. Those who have
staked their money upon the numbers which have turned
up receive the amount of their stakes; the bank takes all
that has been laid upon the figures not represented in the
throw. If two dice fall with the same number uppermost,
those who have staked upon that number will receive
twice the amount of their bets. If all three dice turn up
the same, that number is paid three times over.</p>

<p>It does not require a great mathematician to see that
even at the best of times there is an overwhelming percentage
of the chances in favour of the banker. It is five
to three that he wins any individual bet; the player has
only three chances—those provided by the three dice,
whilst the bank has the chances resting upon the remaining
five squares of the layout.</p>

<p>If we suppose, for example, that the bets upon all the
squares are of an equal amount, which is just about the
most unfortunate arrangement for the banker, the worst
that can happen to him is that all three dice turn up
differently. Then the players who have staked upon
the winning numbers will receive the stakes of those who
have lost, the bank gaining and losing nothing. If two
of the dice turn up the same number, the banker receives
four shillings, say, and pays three. If all three dice turn
up the same, he pays three shillings and receives five.</p>

<p>Cheating is introduced into this game by the banker
in the case of a player persistently backing a high number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
time after time, the method being to ring in a dispatcher
which will fall low. This will materially lessen the
player's chances. If in addition to this a low number is
secured upon one of the other dice, the chances against
the player become five to one. If the player should happen
to be backing a low number, of course a high dispatcher
would be used and a high number secured upon
the other die.</p>

<p><i>Hazard.</i>—This is a game in which the electric dice
are particularly useful to the sharp. It is played with
four dice, only two of which, however, are used at one
time. The player has the option of throwing with any
two of the dice, or exchanging them for the other two
whenever he pleases. There are two kinds of throws
which must be specially mentioned in connection with
this game, viz. those which are called respectively
'crabs' and 'nicks.' A player is said to throw a crab
when the dice turn up either 'pair sixes,' 'pair aces,'
or 'deuce and ace.' These throws instantly lose the
stakes or 'set-money.' A nick is thrown when the aggregate
number of pips turned up amounts to eleven or
seven. Either of these numbers being thrown, the player
throwing wins the set-money.</p>

<p>Apart from a nick or a crab, the first throw made by
the player is called the 'main,' and he must go on throwing
until one of three things happens. Either he eventually
throws a crab and loses, or he throws a nick, or he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
throws a number corresponding to that of his main. In
the event of either of the two latter events occurring, he
wins the stakes. In the case of a player winning with a
nick, however, he still goes on throwing; when he wins
or loses in any other way, the throw passes to his
opponent.</p>

<p>When the main is either four or ten, the chances
against his throwing it again before either a nick or a crab
turns up are in the ratio of two to one. Against five and
nine the chances are as six to four. Against eight and
six the probabilities are six to five. Obviously, then, the
best main to throw is either eight or six, and if the sharp
can contrive to make his main either of these two numbers,
he stands a better chance of winning than one who
does not. He may therefore, for instance, ring in a
loaded die to fall four, and secure the other die to fall two,
leaving the following throws to chance. Having thrown
a main of four or ten, he might secure a six in the latter
case or an ace in the former; this would render his
chances of throwing the same number again about equal.
The most certain method of cheating, however, and that
which leaves no uncertainty as to the result, is to ring
in a loaded die to fall six, and secure either an ace or a
five upon the other. This obviously results in a 'nick,'
and wins the set-money.</p>

<p>Where electric dice are used, cheating at this game
is the simplest thing imaginable. One pair of dice being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
made to fall six and the other one, they may be combined
to give any desired result. If the sharp uses a pair, one
of which will fall six and the other turn up one, the
application of the current will cause him to throw a nick
whenever he pleases. If he gives his dupe a pair which
can be made to fall both sixes or both aces, the sharp
can force his opponent to throw a crab every time if he
chooses to do so. And yet there are some who will argue
that science has conferred no real benefit upon humanity.
Those people are certainly not sharps—they are undoubtedly
flats of the first water.</p>

<p>Before concluding the present chapter, it behoves us
to attend, for a moment, to the methods of falsification
connected with that well-known little device, the 'dice-top'
or 'teetotum.' It deserves just a slight mention,
although the fact that it is not of great importance is
evidenced by the very terse reference made to it in the
various catalogues. This is what one of them says upon
the subject:—</p>

<p>'<i>Dice Tops.</i>—For high and low. Sure thing. Made
of best ivory, $4. Black walnut, just as good, $1.25.'</p>

<p>From even this scanty information, however, we may
gather two things. Firstly, that the top can be made to
fall either high or low, as required—consequently there
is some trick in it; and, secondly, that the trick, whatever
it may be, does not depend upon the material of which
the top is made, since black walnut is just as good as ivory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Better, in fact, because cheaper. The little instrument
itself is shown in the adjoining illustration.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_281.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="185"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 60.</span>
</div>

<p>Here then we have a little hexagonal top, with dice-spots
upon its sides. It is spun with the thumb and
finger, and the number of spots which fall uppermost
in the genuine article, at the time of its running down,
depends entirely upon chance. Not so, however, with
the tops advertised as above. They can be made to fall
in any desired manner. The spindle, instead of being
fixed, as it should be, can be turned
round within the body of the top. Attached
to one side of the spindle, within
the top, and revolving when the spindle
is turned, there is a small weight which
can be set to face either of the sides.
The side opposite which the weight is
allowed to remain is the one which will
lie upon the table when the top comes to rest.</p>

<p>These teetotums are largely used in the States to 'spin
for drinks,' and a very favourite way of working them is
as follows. A man will enter some bar whilst the bar-keeper
is alone, custom being slack. He produces one
of the little articles referred to, and having initiated the
bar-keeper into its capabilities, induces him to purchase
it. In all probability the bar-keeper sets to work with
his new toy, and wins many a drink in the course of the
next few weeks. After awhile, however, two accomplices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of the man who 'traded' the top will present themselves
at the bar, pretending to be more or less intoxicated.
Naturally, the bar-keeper thinks he has a safe thing, and
tries the dice-top upon them. They lose a few bets,
then pretend to lose their temper, and want to bet
heavily upon the results given by the top. To this, of
course, their dupe has not the least objection; he is
only too ready to fall in with their views. But in the
meantime, one of them, under pretence of examining
the top slightly, contrives to ring in another of exactly
similar appearance, but which is set to fall low when the
spindle is turned to face in the same direction as that
given to the other when intended to throw high. The
bar-keeper thus falls an easy victim to the snare. Turn
the spindle as he may, the top absolutely refuses to fall
in the direction he requires.</p>

<p>This, then, exhausts all we have to consider with
reference to dice and their manipulation. If we have
not learnt very much in this branch of the art of
cheating, it is because there is not very much to learn.
Simple as the devices are in this kind of sharping, they
are largely utilised, even at the present day, and
notwithstanding the fact that 'palming' and kindred
methods of concealing small articles are so generally
understood. The great point in the sharp's favour, in
this as in all other manipulations, is that his dupes are
not expecting trickery, and consequently do not look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
it. It is highly probable that as much money has
changed hands over games of dice as in connection
with any other form of gambling, horse-racing, perhaps,
excepted. Years ago, of course, the dice-box was a
much more familiar object than at the present day; still
even now it flourishes with undiminished vitality in
many parts of the world. Well, those who deal with
the dice will always pay dearly for experience, which
may be bought <i>too</i> dearly sometimes. <i>Caveat emptor.</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>HIGH-BALL POKER</i></span></h2>

<p>The game of 'high-ball poker' is one which is essentially
American, both in origin and character. It is somewhat
simpler than the proper game, but possesses no
particular advantages over poker, as played with cards,
beyond the fact of its comparative simplicity. On the
other hand, the appliances required for playing it are more
expensive, and not nearly so convenient. Possibly the
original idea of its introduction arose from the fact that
the fraudulent manipulation of the cards, in the other
game, had become notorious, and it was hoped that this
kind of thing would be obviated by using balls instead.
It is far more likely, however, that this variety of the game
presented certain advantages to the sharp which the other
did not possess, and hence its popularity in certain
quarters. It would be unwise, however, to hazard an
opinion one way or the other. All we need trouble ourselves
about is that cheating at this game is both simple
and tolerably safe. No special skill is required on the part
of the sharp, and very little special apparatus, to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
him to win whenever he pleases, and as long as he can
get people to play with him.</p>

<p>The game is played with a leathern bottle, something
like those used in 'pool,' but smaller in the neck. Into
this bottle are put twenty-four balls about an inch in
diameter, each of which is numbered upon a facet, the
numbers running from one to twenty-four consecutively.
The players sit round the table, and the bets are arranged
in the same manner as at poker. The player whose turn
it is to deal shakes up the balls in the bottle, and deals
one to each player, himself included, no player being
allowed to see the balls which are dealt to the others.
The players look at the balls they have received, each one
noting the number which has fallen to him, and coming
in or declining to play accordingly, stake their bets.
This being done, a second ball is dealt to each player,
and the two balls thus received constitute his hand.
The betting now proceeds as at poker, the rules being
precisely the same, except that the balls rank according
to their numerical value, and that the complications
arising from 'pairs,' 'threes,' 'fours,' and 'flushes,'
cannot arise. Those who have bad hands will fall out
of the game for the time being, sacrificing the stakes
they have put into the pool, whilst those who consider
their hands good enough to bet on will remain in and
'raise' each other. If one player can so increase the
stakes as to drive all the others out, he will take the pool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
without showing his hand; or a player may be 'called,'
and then the hands are shown, the best one winning the
whole of the stakes.</p>

<p>The reader will perceive that cheating might be
practised in connection with this game in a variety of
ways. The dealer, in putting the balls into the bottle,
might contrive to secrete a high number, which could be
held out for a time, and afterwards rung in to his own
hand, in place of a low one. In a conspiracy of two or
three players, nothing could be easier than for them to
signal to each other the value of their hands, and thus
arrive at a fairly approximate knowledge of what hands
they might have to contend with. They could then act
in accordance with the information thus gained, and
either stand out or raise the other players, as the nature
of their hands may dictate. If, in addition to this, each
of the conspirators was provided with duplicates of two
or three of the highest numbers, the one who had the
best hand could substitute for the lower number in his
hand the highest number in either of the hands held by
his accomplices, and thus, in all probability, constitute
himself the winner, the accomplice meanwhile substituting
his best number for that discarded by his
partner in the conspiracy. They would not require
many duplicate balls each; just two or three of the
highest numbers would be quite sufficient.</p>

<p>There are, however, great objections to any manipulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of this kind; more particularly since cheating can
be accomplished, by mechanical means, in a much more
simple and effective manner. The method of cheating
usually adopted, therefore, takes the form of a 'bottle-holdout,'
which can be caused to retain any of the
highest numbers and to deliver them to either of the
players, at the will of the dealer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_287.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="396"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 61.</span>
</div>

<p>This holdout is, of course, within the bottle itself,
and is operated by pressure upon the slightly flexible
sides. Fig. 61 is an illustration of a bottle of this kind,
part of one side being cut away to allow the holdout
to be seen. A represents the position of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
parts at such times as the holdout may be either
inoperative or containing the balls. B will serve to
indicate the position they assume when the sides are
pressed, and the holdout is either receiving or delivering
the balls.</p>

<p>The holdout itself consists of a kind of scoop,
pivoted to a bracket in such a way that it will either
turn up against one side of the bottle, or lie open
beneath the neck. This scoop <i>a</i> has a projecting
tail-piece or lever, against which a spring <i>d</i> constantly
presses, and retains the scoop in contact with the side
of the bottle. To the end of this lever is jointed a rod
<i>c</i>, the further end of which just reaches across to the
opposite side of the bottle. It is obvious, then, that if
the bottle is squeezed by the dealer, the pressure being
applied to the point of contact with the rod, and to
some point behind the bracket to which the scoop is
pivoted (between <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>, in short), the end of the
lever will be pressed towards the side of the bottle, and
the scoop will consequently be turned down into the
position shown at B. The whole of the working parts,
together with the inside of the bottle, are painted black,
in order to prevent any possibility of the device being
seen by looking down the neck.</p>

<p>In returning the balls to the interior of the bottle, the
dealer carefully notes their value. The low ones are
allowed to fall in the proper manner, but when a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
one is dropped inside, the bottle is squeezed in the
manner above indicated, the scoop comes down, and
that ball therefore falls into the holdout. Then in
dealing the device is utilised in the same way. The
low balls are dealt to the dupes, but in the act of
dealing to a confederate, or to himself, as the case may
be, the bottle is pressed and high balls only are dealt.
As a rule one ball only is held out.</p>

<p>There is not very much in this game beyond the
ingenuity of the holdout employed, and the money
which may be won by its means. But since the
necessity of including it among the explanations given
in this book is obvious, and since there is no definite
section of the subject to which it can be referred, it has
had to receive, however unworthily, the distinction of
having a chapter to itself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br>

<span class="smaller"><i>ROULETTE AND ALLIED GAMES</i></span></h2>

<p>Roulette, and the various modifications of the game,
which have been introduced from time to time, have all
had, to a greater or less extent, a fascination for the
gambler. That roulette itself still maintains a prominent
place among the multitudinous methods of dissipating
wealth to which gamblers are addicted, can be fully
vouched for by those who have visited the gaming-tables
of such a place as Monte Carlo. Despite the efforts of
civilisation, 'the man that broke the bank,' or is said to
have done so, is still prominent among us; but the
bank that broke the man is, unfortunately, much more
in evidence.</p>

<p>The methods of play adopted by the great gaming
establishments of the world are unquestionably as fair
as the nature of things will allow them to be. No man
can run an establishment of any kind without profit,
and the profits of these gaming-houses result from the
apparently small chances in favour of the bank which
are universally allowed. The fact that the <i>apparently</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
small chances against the players as a body are not
generally recognised as being in reality great, cannot be
said to be the fault of the bankers themselves. They
build palatial edifices, lay out luxurious gardens, pay
their crowds of retainers handsome salaries, and still
have profits sufficient to bring them in princely incomes,
the entire expenses of the whole being defrayed at the
cost of the players, and through the medium of those
insignificant chances in the bank's favour. It is strange
that the players cannot see it, but they do not seem to
realise that it is they themselves who pay for these
things; or, if they do see it, they play with the wild hope
of being among the few fortunate ones and sharing in
the plunder. Taken as a whole, it may be estimated
that the profits of these places amount to five per cent. or
over of every pound that is staked upon the tables.
That is to say, every player who places a sovereign upon
the green cloth puts, definitely and unmistakably, at
least a shilling into the pockets of the proprietors, who
have, in the long run, absolutely no risk whatever.
They have merely to furnish the accessories, and the
players will provide all the rest, simply paying their
money to the bank and taking all the risk themselves.
No player can gain at the expense of the bank; if one
should happen to make his fortune at play, he can only
do so by the ruin of some other player. That is the
plain state of the case, and there is no getting over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
It is not, however, with the so-called genuine gambling
concerns that we have now to deal, but with the little
hole-and-corner dens which may be found in various
parts of the world, and particularly in the two continents
of America. In such as these the roulette-table is
frequently a familiar object, and very often it is not
quite such a genuine piece of apparatus as it appears.
Those who may not happen to be acquainted with the
arrangement should understand that it is an oblong
table, having a circular cavity at one end, in which the
roulette revolves. The roulette (literally 'little wheel') is
simply a revolving disc surrounded by a number of cavities
into which a ball is allowed to roll. These cavities are
numbered, and those who have staked upon the number
of the particular hole into which the ball finds its way
receive their stakes back, together with an amount
equivalent to the money they have staked multiplied by
the number of holes remaining vacant in the roulette,
<i>minus</i> a certain percentage which is reserved in favour of
the bank. This is the essential principle of the game,
though in reality it is played with many complications
of chances, into which it is not necessary here to
enter.</p>

<p>Cheating in connection with the roulette-table is
accomplished by means of a 'faked' or falsified roulette.
This is arranged so that the numbers around the periphery
are not consecutive, but alternately high and low.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Indeed, this is the usual arrangement, therefore there is
nothing suspicious in that fact. The numbered divisions
into one of which the ball eventually rolls are formed by
equidistant copper bands, set radially from the centre of
rotation; and, in the false roulette, the copper partitions
are so constructed as to be movable in two sets, one
moving one way, and the other in the opposite direction.
Each alternate partition belongs to the opposite set to
its two immediate neighbours, consequently the movement
of the partitions alternately in opposite directions
tends to widen one set of cavities and narrow the others.
If, then, the original width of the cavities was only just
sufficient to allow the ball to drop into either of them, a
very slight movement in one direction or the other will
serve to prevent the ball from falling into any cavity of
one set, whilst allowing it readily to enter either of the
other set. Before spinning the roulette, then, the man
whose place it is to do so notes the disposition of the
bets. If they are principally staked upon the high
numbers, he just gives a little twist to the centre of the
roulette, in the direction which slightly closes the high
numbers and correspondingly opens the low ones. Then
the high numbers are bound to lose. Should the bets, on
the other hand, be principally upon the low numbers, the
spindle is turned in the other direction, thus closing the
low numbers and opening the high ones. In this way
the bank can never lose by any possible chance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
movement given to the alternate partitions is, of course,
very slight, one-sixteenth of an inch being ample for the
purpose.</p>

<p>To enable the reader to better understand the
principle involved in this system of cheating, we will
investigate its application to a simple modification of
the roulette which is sometimes used, and which affords
great convenience for the method of falsification we
have been considering. This is a wheel composed of a
circular centre-piece, with two flat circular plates larger in
diameter than the centre or 'hub,' one being fixed above
and the other below it. Radially between these flanges,
and at equal distances apart, are fixed partitions, which
thus convert the periphery of the wheel into a number
of chambers or divisions. A (fig. 62) represents the
plan of a wheel of this kind, and B shows the same in
elevation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">
  <img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20Sharps%20and%20Flats,%20by%20John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne_fichiers/i_295.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="277"><br>
  <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 62.</span>
</div>

<p>Now, these radial partitions mentioned above are
not all fixed to the wheel in the same manner. Each
alternate one is attached to the centre or hub, and the
others are fixed to the flanges or cheeks. C in the
illustration represents the latter, and D the former.
The two halves of the wheel C and D being put
together, they appear to constitute a genuine wheel such
as A. It is obvious, then, that if these two halves can
be made to move just a little in opposite directions
around their common centre, each alternate division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
will become slightly narrower or wider than its
immediate neighbours, as the case may be. Then, if
the divisions are numbered alternately high and low, it
stands to reason that the high numbers can be closed
and the low ones opened, or <i>vice versa</i>, at will. In the
illustration, E represents the wheel after the two
sections have been turned one upon the other in this
way. It will be seen that <i>n</i> is a narrow division, and
<i>w</i> a wide one; whilst right and left of these the
divisions are alternately wide and narrow. A wheel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
this kind would be mounted upon a spindle, in the
centre of a circular depression in the table-top. After it
has been set spinning, a ball is thrown into the circular
hollow, down the sloping sides of which it rolls, and
finally arrives in one of the divisions of the wheel, in
this case entering by the periphery. In order to give
the thing more the appearance of a game of skill, a
wheel of this kind is sometimes mounted at one end of
a sort of bagatelle-table, and, whilst it is spinning, the
players are allowed to drive the ball into it with a cue
from the far end of the table, each player in succession
taking his turn at the ball. Needless to say, however,
this plan presents no particular advantage to the player.
If he has backed a high number, and the high numbers
are closed against him, it is evident that he cannot
possibly cause the ball to enter the division he requires,
do what he may.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that in the roulette the
divisions, in addition to being numbered alternately high
and low, are also alternately coloured red and black,
and the players have the option of betting upon either
colour. That is to say, if the ball rolls into a red division,
irrespective of its number, those who have staked upon
the red will receive the value of their stakes, whilst
those who have wagered upon black will lose their money.
Even in this case, however, the chances in favour of the
bank will tell in the long run, because the 'zeros,' the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
numbers reserved for the bank, are neither red nor
black, and if the ball enters a zero neither red nor
black will win. The alternate arrangement of the red
and black divisions will indicate, at once, that the same
device which controls the entrance of the ball into the
high or low numbers can also be made to cause either
red or black to win, at the pleasure of the bank. In that
case there is not much need to trouble about the effect
of 'zero' one way or the other.</p>

<p>A gentleman, well known in artistic circles, has
favoured me, through a mutual friend, with the following
interesting account of a swindle perpetrated in connection
with roulette here in London. He entitles it 'A
True Gambling Experience'; and it is here given as
nearly as possible in his own words.</p>

<p>'Some time ago, a friend of mine wrote to me, asking
if I would like to go to a gamble at the rooms of a Mr.
X——, who had acquired a certain notoriety by gaining
large sums at Monte Carlo. Indeed, his name was mentioned
almost daily in the London Press. I went, and
the game of roulette was played, the guests being regaled
at about midnight with a most excellent supper
and "Pol Roger" <i>ad lib.</i></p>

<p>'The company was mixed—a few men from club-land,
a well-known money-lender, and two fair ladies. One
lady was our hostess, the other was the celebrated
Baroness ——. The game was played quite fairly, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
board being one of those ordinarily used in England,
with one "zero." The stakes were limited to 20<i>l.</i> upon
the even money chances.</p>

<p>'At the end of the evening, our host—the much-talked-of
gentleman of Monte Carlo—who had won
about 1,000<i>l.</i> during the sitting, appointed another
evening, and asked me if I would mind taking the bank.
I consented, provided that I might stop when I had lost
as much as I cared to risk. This was acceded to, and I
took the bank on the following week, when I arose a
loser of some 300<i>l.</i>, but had such consolation as was to
be derived from partaking of a supper similar in character
to the first, everything being absolutely <i>en prince</i>. A
game of baccarat followed, and a friend of mine was
fortunate enough to win some hundreds from our host.
I myself, having settled up all my losings at roulette,
was a gainer of fifty sovereigns or so. At the end of the
evening, our host excused himself from payment, on the
ground that he had had a very bad week racing, and had
a very heavy settlement to make on the Monday, "I
know," he said, "you and your friend will not mind waiting
until next week, when we will have another evening."
Of course we agreed to wait until the next meeting.</p>

<p>'Some days after, I had a letter from Mr. X——,
stating that he had much pleasure in sending me a
cheque (enclosed), and remarking that he intended having
an evening at the rooms of a friend of his, near Charing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Cross. The evening arrived, and I duly wended my
way to the address Mr. X—— had given me. I found
about twenty people assembled, among them my friend
and another man I knew. I went up to the former and
asked him if Mr. X—— had paid up the money he owed
him. "Oh yes," he said, "he has paid me in those,"
pointing to a heap of counters in front of him. The
game had commenced when I arrived, and I noticed
that the limit of the stakes was double that of the former
occasions, viz. 40<i>l.</i> upon the even money chances. I
further noticed that a Frenchman (who could not speak
a word of English) was turning the wheel, and Mr. X——
was acting as "croupier." The board was not similar to
that used on former occasions.</p>

<p>'The game proceeded, the Frenchman rolling the
ball, and Mr. X—— raking in the losing and paying out
the winning stakes. Every now and then a man would
retire hard hit, whilst others were constantly arriving.
Business was brisk, a good trade was being carried on,
but nobody knew how certain the bank was of winning.
A Rothschild could not have stood against that board,
as I afterwards discovered.</p>

<p>'Presently, one of the players got up and said, "I
think that is seven hundred I owe you, X——," and proceeded
to try and write a cheque for the amount upon a
blank sheet of paper; but finding he could not write
distinctly, he called to the money-lender, who filled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the body of the cheque, and then the half-tipsy punter
signed it and left. Several large cheques were paid to
X—— upon various players taking their departure; and
I, having lost 10<i>l.</i> punting in sovereigns, wrote a cheque
for that amount. In the meantime, my friend who had
been paid by X—— some hundreds in counters, as
before mentioned, had lost them all, and had a debit of
about 400<i>l.</i> against him. He was staking the maximum
each time on either red or black. Sometimes he had a
maximum on one of the other chances. The luck (?)
was dead against him, and he only won once in every
three or four coups. He came into the next room with
me and had a brandy and soda. "My luck is terrible,"
he said, "awful! but I am going to sit it out. The
chances must average up presently." Such, however,
was not the case. He lost more and more, whilst beads
of perspiration stood upon his forehead.</p>

<p>'Relaxing for a moment my attention from my friend
and his play, and glancing at the roulette revolving, I
noticed the ball roll into division No. 3, red. Strange to
say, however, when the roulette came to rest, the winning
number proved to be No. 26, black. Even then the
thought did not occur to me that there was anything
wrong; but shortly afterwards a similar event occurred,
and <i>then</i> I felt sure there was a swindle somewhere. I
went into the cloak-room where we had left our outer
apparel, and putting on my opera hat and cape, returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to the scene. I pulled my hat well over my eyes and
watched the board. Having a quick eye, and being used
to roulette, I soon fathomed what is possibly the most
beautiful swindle ever invented. The partitions which
form the divisions into which the ball runs were constructed
in one piece and movable, altogether apart
from the numbers between which they were situated. In
pressing upon the roulette to stop its motion in the
usual manner, a sort of ratchet movement could be
actuated which would turn the whole of the divisions
round, carrying the ball with them, from one number to
the next. Thus red could be turned into black, manque
into passe, or pair into impair, according to the manner
in which the stakes were placed.</p>

<p>'I was so completely upset by my discovery of this
colossal swindle that I unfortunately committed a <i>faux
pas</i> which enabled the gang to escape punishment. After
I was thoroughly certain of the <i>modus operandi</i>, I
looked round the room to see what help was at hand in
the event of a tussle; but, not liking the look of the
crowd, I decided to obtain assistance from the outside.
Before doing so, I felt that my clear duty was to speak
to the host, who had lent his rooms to Mr. X——. I
motioned him apart, and on telling him that I wished to
speak to him privately, he took me into his bedroom.
"Mr. Z——," I said, "I think it my duty to tell you that
this game is a gigantic swindle. The men who have lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
have been cheated out of their money," and I described
the process to him. "It cannot be true," said he, "I
have known X—— for years, and have been engaged in
several large financial transactions with him, and I would
stake my life upon his integrity." "Well," I said, "that
may be so, but I am certain of what I say, and I shall
prevent all the payment I can. As for my cheque of
10<i>l.</i>, I shall stop it at the bank." (That cheque has
never been presented from that day to this).</p>

<p>'I went out into the passage, leaving Z—— in his bedroom,
and at that moment the well-known Mr. ——,
F.R.C.S. was admitted at the door. I whispered to him,
"Play small and watch it," and went off for a detective.
I was afterwards informed by my "sawbones" friend that
play was stopped directly I left.</p>

<p>'The rest of the tale is soon told. I met my unfortunate
friend outside his house, and found he had
ended in losing 1,300<i>l.</i> His state was truly pitiable, and
his relief was great when I told him that he need not
pay a penny, as he had been duped.</p>

<p>'The next day private detectives were busy; but, unfortunately,
the mechanical board had escaped them,
and Mr. X—— and his confederates had cleared out of
London.</p>

<p>'Would you believe it? X—— went to a well-known
firm of solicitors, and wanted to commence an action
against me; but they advised him to refrain from so doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
'I traced many of the punters who had lost money
that evening, and stopped the payment of very much
that would otherwise have found its way into the pockets
of the swindlers. The men whose interests I thus protected
never thanked me. All I contrived to do for myself
was to make many enemies. For the future I intend
to leave the exposure of swindlers to those who are
accustomed to that kind of work.'</p>

<p>Under the general term of 'spindle-games,' a great
variety of revolving wheels and pointers is sold. In all
cases the 'game' consists of betting against the bank,
upon the chances of a ball rolling into a certain compartment,
or of a pointer coming to rest opposite a
certain number or division upon a dial. Countless are
the dodges and devices resorted to with the object of
controlling the chances or of removing them altogether.
Things of this kind are commonly used for the purposes
of cheating at race-meetings and horse fairs 'out west.'
We have already seen how anything in the nature of a
roulette can be sophisticated so as to give the bank every
advantage, and insure certain loss to the players; and
from this we may judge that something similar is
possible in the case of a pointer or 'spear.' Indeed,
the possibilities in this direction are endless, and all
sorts of brakes and such devices for bringing the
pointer to rest at a given spot have been invented. As
an example we will investigate one system, which is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
all probability the most ingenious ever devised, and
which is but little known.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the head of a well-known firm of
electricians and experimentalists in Manchester was
approached by an American, with a view to their undertaking
the manufacture of a piece of apparatus, part of
the drawings for which he submitted. The firm agreed
to make what was required, and the work was commenced.
As to what the apparatus could possibly be, or for what
use it was intended, the manufacturers were completely
in ignorance. Never having had experience of anything
of the kind before, the whole thing was a mystery to them:
all that they could infer from the utterances of their
customer was that it was something in the nature of an
experiment, and one which was of the greatest importance.
Expense was absolutely no object whatever; all
they had to concern themselves with was to see that the
apparatus was thoroughly well and accurately made, and
in accordance with the drawings given them.</p>

<p>The contrivance itself was a sort of circular table-top;
but, instead of being made of one solid thickness of wood,
it was constructed in three sections or layers. The top
and bottom pieces were simply plain discs, whilst the
central one was a ring. These, being fastened together,
made a kind of shallow box, the interior of which could
be reached by removing either the top or bottom of the
whole arrangement. Into this internal circular cavity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
was fitted a disc of such a size that it was capable of
turning freely within the table top without rattling about.
Radially from the centre of this disc were cut about six
or eight slots, at equal distances from each other, and
sufficiently large to contain each a bar-magnet. The
magnets being fixed into their respective slots, the disc
carrying them was placed into the cavity prepared for
its reception, and the outer wood-work was firmly glued
together. To all outward appearance, then, the thing
became simply a table-top, made in three thicknesses,
the 'grain' of the middle thickness crossing that of the
other two; an arrangement often adopted in cabinetwork
to prevent warping. In the under side of the
table-top, however, there was cut a small slot, concentric
with the outer edge. This gave access to the movable
piece within the interior, and a small stud was fixed into
that piece, projecting a little beyond the under surface,
so that by its means the inner piece could be revolved a
short distance to the right or left.</p>

<p>This incomprehensible scientific instrument having
been completed to the satisfaction of the American
gentleman, it was taken away by him, and the firm
expected to hear nothing more of it. In this, however,
they were mistaken. A few days afterwards their
customer again called upon them, bringing with him
another drawing, and requesting them to make this
second device in accordance with his instructions. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
drawing presented for the inspection of the firm this time
was a representation of a very heavy iron pointer, so
constructed as to revolve upon a pivot at its centre.
Strange to say, the length of the pointer was just about
equal to the diameter of the internal disc of the table-top
previously made. The head of the firm began to 'smell
a rat.' That pointer had served to point out to him the
solution of what was previously inexplicable. Having
formed his own conclusions, he openly taxed the
American with having lured him into making an
apparatus for cheating. Perfectly unabashed, the man
admitted the soft impeachment, and quite calmly and
collectedly revealed the full particulars of his system, as
though it were nothing at all unusual, and quite in the
ordinary way of business.</p>

<p>It appeared that this innocent form of amusement
was intended to be taken 'out west,' and brought into
action principally at horse-fairs. The table-top which
the firm had made was destined to be covered with
green cloth, in the centre of which a circle was marked
out, its circumference being divided into spaces coloured
alternately black and red. The number of these spaces
was twice that of the magnets within the table. Thus,
by moving the stud projecting below the table-top the
magnets could be made to lie beneath either colour
whilst the proprietor <i>lied</i> over the whole. Obviously,
then, the iron pointer would always come to rest above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
one of the magnets, and in this way the colour at which
it was allowed to stop could be decided by the operator.
His plan of working was simply to note which colour
had the most money staked upon it, and set his magnets
so as to cause the pointer to stop at the other. Using
an apparatus of this kind, the man had already made
thousands of dollars; and he only required this improved
and perfected machine to enable him to go back and
make thousands more. The Americans are pretty
generally regarded as being a smart people—but are
they? In some ways, perhaps.</p>

<p>All this being explained to the head of the Manchester
firm, the natural exclamation which fell from him was,
'But suppose anyone among the bystanders happened to
bring out a mariner's compass?' It appeared, however,
even in that case, that all was not lost, and that the
swindler would be equal to the occasion. Quietly
putting his hand between his coat-tails, he drew out a
neat little 'Derringer,' about a foot long, and observed,
'Wal, <i>sir</i>, I guess that compass would never git
around <i>my</i> table. You kin bet on <i>that</i>.' That's the
sort of man <i>he</i> was.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>SPORTING-HOUSES</i></span></h2>

<p>We now come to a consideration of the so-called
'sporting-houses,' otherwise, the firms who supply
sharps with the appliances and tools of their craft.
These places are many, and, as a rule, prosperous.
Their dealings in 'advantage goods,' as these things are
called by the fraternity, are of course 'under the rose,'
and the real nature of their business is covered by the
fact that they are supposed to be dealers in honest
commodities of various kinds. Some of these people
keep 'emporiums' for the ostensible sale of genuine
gambling appliances, such as faro-tables, billiard-tables,
dice, cards, &amp;c. Others will run businesses which are
far removed from anything in the nature of gambling.
The cheating business is, of course, kept in the background,
although no great secret would appear to be
made of it; the inference being, one may suppose, that
it is not criminal to sell these things, although it is
undoubtedly so to use them.</p>

<p>Until quite recently it was no uncommon thing to
find advertisements in certain of the American newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to some such effect as 'Holdouts and other Sporting
Tools.—Apply to Messrs. So-and-So,' giving the name and
address. An advertisement of this kind would, of course,
be simply Greek to the majority, although the sharps
would understand its meaning readily enough. Upon
applying to the advertiser, a sharp would receive a
voluminous price list, setting forth the manifold beauties
and advantages of the wares at his disposal, and showing
conclusively that no other dealer had things so good to
sell, and that the advertising firm was the most fair dealing
and conscientious in the world, if their own account
of themselves might be trusted.</p>

<p>The first specimen of these literary and artistic productions
to which we shall refer is a very exhaustive
affair; so much so, in fact, that space will not allow it to
be reprinted in its entirety. Besides cheating appliances
it quotes all kinds of genuine gambling tools, which are
of no importance to us in our present inquiry. Such
parts, then, as have no reference to cheating have been
excised, to avoid crowding these pages with unnecessary
matter. The reader who has conscientiously followed,
and taken pains to understand the explanations
contained in previous chapters, will have no difficulty in
arriving at a very fair notion of the various items given,
and the significance of much that, otherwise, would
possess no meaning for him. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/41169/41169-h/images/i_310.jpg">This catalogue</a> is issued

The next catalogue to which we refer hails from the
State of New York, and is that from which extracts have
been made during the progress of this book. It is particularly
amusing, and deserves careful perusal on that
account.</p>

<div class="catalog">

<p class="p0 p1 center">THE LATEST SLEEVE HOLDOUT</p>

<p>The finest machine in this country. All late improvements,
better made than some machines that are sold for
$300. A better machine than the Kepplinger, of San Francisco,
holdout. Made of fine and light pen steel, and works
as well in shirt sleeves as with a coat on. The machine is
fastened in a double shirt sleeve. The cards go in between
the wristband and cuff. The wristband and cuff closes up
when the cards are in, and anyone may look up your sleeve
to your elbow and cannot see anything wrong. The holdout
is worked by spreading your knees. The string runs through
steel tubing that has capped pulley wheel joints. The string
cannot bind or catch, and will work smoothly, easy, and
noiselessly, every time alike. Give length of arm and size
of shirt worn when ordering. Price, $100. Will send one
C. O. D. $75, with privilege to examine, on receipt of $25.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">KEPPLINGER VEST, OR COAT MACHINE</p>

<p>New, never before advertised. Made on same principle
as the sleeve holdout, and works by spreading knees.
String goes through adjustable tubing. Vest closes up tight
when cards are in, and looks to be all buttoned up tight.
Works equally well in coat. (This is almost a nickle-in-slot
machine, and I will guarantee perfect satisfaction to anyone
that wants a first-class vest or coat holdout.) Sent in vest
all ready to put on and work. Price $75. Will send one
C. O. D. $60, privilege to examine and try in express office,
on receipt of $15.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">STUD POKER HOLDOUT</p>

<p>Very light and compact, works under any ordinary cuff.
Cards come out to palm of hand and go back out of sight.
Works automatically by resting arm on edge of table. Also
a good machine to cap the deck with. Price $30. Sent
C. O. D. $20, privilege to examine, on receipt of $15.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">ARM PRESSURE VEST MACHINE</p>

<p>This machine weighs about three ounces, and is used half
way down the vest, where it comes natural to hold your
hands and cards. The work is done with one hand and the
lower part of the same arm. You press against a small lever
with the arm (an easy pressure of three-quarters of an inch
throws out the cards back of a few others held in your left
hand), and you can reach over to your checks or do anything
else with the right hand while working the holdout. The
motions are all natural, and do not cause suspicion. The
machine is held in place by a web belt; you don't have to
sew anything fast, but when you get ready to play you can
put on the machine, and when through can remove it in half
a minute. There are no plates, no strings to pull on, and no
springs that are liable to break or get out of order. This
machine is worth fifty of the old style vest plates for practical
use, and you will say the same after seeing one. Price $15.
Will send one C. O. D. $10, with privilege to examine, on
receipt of $5. Will send one by registered mail on receipt
of price, with the understanding that you may return it in
exchange for other goods if not perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">ARM PRESSURE SLEEVE MACHINE</p>

<p>Same price and style as the arm pressure vest machine.
(This holdout is the lightest and smoothest working arm
pressure sleeve holdout made.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">TEN DOLLAR SLEEVE HOLDOUT</p>

<p>Light and compact, can be put on or taken off in two
minutes, works by raising and lowering your arm. A good
machine for small games. Sent by registered mail on receipt
of the price.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">AUTOMATIC TABLE HOLDOUT</p>

<p>Lightest made, fastens by patent steel claw. Can be put
under a table and taken off instantly, as there are no screws
or anything to fasten permanently. Works by knee, and
brings the card up on top of the table. Price $20. Sent
C. O. D., privilege to examine, on receipt of $5.</p>

<p><i>Notice.</i>—I can make this holdout or my stud poker
holdout, either one, to work a fine reflector for reading the
cards, at same price.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">TO SMART POKER PLAYERS</p>

<p>I have invented a process by which a man is sure of
winning if he can introduce his own cards. The cards are
not trimmed or marked in any way, shape, or manner.
They can be handled and shuffled by all at the board, and,
without looking at a card, you can, by making two or three
shuffles or ripping them in, oblige the dealer to give three of
a kind to any one playing, or the same advantage can be
taken on your own deal. This is a big thing for any game.
In euchre you can hold the joker every time, or the cards
most wanted in any game. The process is very hard to
detect, as the cards look perfectly natural, and it is something
card-players are not looking for. Other dealers have been
selling sanded cards, or cheap cards with spermaceti rubbed
on, and calling them professional playing or magnetic cards.
I don't want you to class my cards with that kind of trash.
I use a liquid preparation put on with rollers on all cards
made; this dries on the cards and does not show, and will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>last as long as the cards do. The object is to make certain
cards, not prepared, slip off easier than others in shuffling.
You can part or break the deck to an ace or king, and easily
'put up threes,' no matter where they lay in the deck. This
fine advantage works fine single handed, or when the left-hand
man shuffles and offers the cards to be cut. These
cards are ten times better than readers or strippers, and they
get the money faster. Price $2 per pack by mail, $20 per
dozen packs. If you order a dozen, I will furnish cards like
you use.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">CUFF HOLDOUT</p>

<p>Weighs two ounces, and is a neat invention to top the
deck, to help a partner, or hold out a card playing stud
poker; also good to play the half stock in seven up. This
holdout works in the shirt sleeve, and holds the cards in the
same place as a cuff pocket. There is no part of the holdout
in sight at any time. A man that has worked a pocket will
appreciate this invention. Price, by registered mail, $10.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">RING HOLDOUT</p>

<p>Fits under any ring worn on third finger. A fine thing
to top the deck. You can hold as many cards as you wish
in your hand, and no one will mistrust you, as your fingers
will be at perfect liberty, and it is not necessary to keep them
together as you have to do when palming. Price, by registered
mail, $3.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">TABLE HOLDOUT</p>

<p>Very small and light. It can be put under and removed
from any table in less than half a minute. Works easily from
either knee. It will bring three or more cards up into your
hand, and take back the discards as you hold your cards and
hands in a natural position on top of the table. It is the
best table holdout made. Price, by registered mail, $10.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>Will send one C. O. D., with privilege to examine, on receipt
of $3.</p>

<p>Round corners, big squeezers, first quality linen stock,
warranted. Price, per pack, $1&nbsp;25; six packs, $7; one
dozen packs, $12.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">TO CARD PLAYERS</p>

<p>These cards are by far the finest-marked cards ever

and it is the best offer ever made to club-rooms and private

placed on the market.</p>

<p>They are especially adapted for fine work, and great care
has been given to the marking of both size and suit, and it is
almost an impossibility to find the marks and earn the combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>without the key and complete printed instructions
which we send with every pack; but when learned they are
as easily read from the back as from the face.</p>

<p class="p0 p1 center">TO FARO DEALERS</p>

<p>We handle, and keep constantly in stock, all the latest
and best combination boxes, both end squeeze, top balance,
lever and side movement, etc., etc., but we make a speciality
of our own boxes, and recommend them to any one needing a
<i>good reliable box, that can be depended on at all times</i>. These
boxes are simple, durable, and by far the best boxes ever
placed on the market. We make them up perfectly plain,
without bars, have the bottom movement (entirely new), and
they can be locked to a dead square box by a table movement
which cannot be detected. We make our boxes up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>lock by three combinations, and we <i>guarantee them in every
way</i>.</p>

            <td class="tdr cat">50</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

<p>We also make an end squeeze that no one can tell from
a square box, as the end of box is immovable, the metal of
the end being thinner than rest of box, being able to spring
or give as it is pressed, and doing the work. This is one of
the finest boxes ever made. Price $100.</p>

<p>We also make plain tell boxes, without bars, <i>which can
be charged</i> [query '<i>changed</i>'] from a square to a tell box in
an instant without the possibility of detection, and we will
guarantee that no one can find the combination. (Do not
confound these with the ordinary lock-up sand tell box.)</p>

<p>Our boxes are perfect in every particular, and will do the
work. The cards for these boxes are specially prepared by
a machine which takes the place of sand and all kinds of
preparation. They are by far superior to any cards sanded
or prepared by hand. Our manner of preparing cards for
these boxes is by having the twelve paint cards prepared, so
by playing in the high card <i>the money is won without
creating suspicion</i>, by being always actually on the card with
the work on.</p>

<p>These are the instructions sent out with the fluids
used for marking cards. The spelling must not be
criticised. It is similar to that of the original:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<div class="catalog">

<p class="p0 p1 center">'DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND USING
OUR COLORS.</p>

<p>'Take the color that comes nearest to the color of the
card you want to use it on, put a few drops in an empty
bottle, and dilute with Alcohol untill you get a Shade as near
like the Card as possible. To avoid spilling, as sometimes
happens in trying to pour or drop, the dye may be lifted out
of the bottles with the brush, by repeatedly dipping the
brush into them, and then wiping the brush on the mouth of
the empty Bottle. It is better to put the Alcohol into the
empty bottle <i>first</i>, then when you lift the dye out on the
brush you can dip the brush right in the Alcohol, and tell
better when you have the right shade. As you mix the
colors, try them on a surface like that on which you may intend
to use them, in this way any shade may be obtained.
Always bear in mind that the Colors show <i>deeper</i> when
<i>moist</i>, (as is the case when they are first put on), and become
fainter as they dry, and when dry if they are <i>too light</i>, go
over them again. Eveness is more apt to be obtained by
using a little lighter shade of color after the first application.</p>

<p>'A little care and practice will enable any one to handle
these colors satisfactorily.</p>

<p>'In marking you can pick out any number of figures from
four to six, having them as near the upper left hand corner
as conveneient, a Flower which has 5 leaves is best, or the
right number of figures in a circle.</p>

<p>'Shade all the figures except No. 1, leaving it light or
natural for the Ace, No. 2 light for King, No. 3 light for
Queen, No. 4 for Jack, No. 5 for 10 spot, 1 &amp; 2 light for
9 spot, 2 and 3 for 8, 3 and 4 for 7, 4 and 5 for 6, 5 and 1 for
5, 2 and 5 for 4, 2 and 4 for 3, and 3 and 5 for 2. In doing
<i>very nice work</i> we shade the entire back of the card <i>except</i>
the <i>figure</i> which denotes the size and suit.</p>

<p>'For suit pick out two figures near those you use for size,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>and have <i>both dark for Clubs</i>, and both light or natural for
Diamonds, have one of them dark for Spades; and the other
dark for Hearts. With six figures the combination runs
similar to the five figures which we have ezplained, and a
four figure runs the same down to the seven spot. After a
little practice you will see many ways of marking your cards.</p>

<p>'The Dyes we use are the Diamond Package Dyes, and
can be had of most any Druggist. Make the Dyes according
to Directions on the package, using only one <i>half the
quantity of water</i> directed, and strain through a cloth, if
there is any sediment in the dye after adding the Alcohol
strain it again as it is necessary to have it as clear as possible.
Do not try to use the dyes without the Alcohol, or it will be
a failure, as it is the Alcohol which causes the Dye to strike
into the card. Always keep the bottles well corked when
not using them. Brushes and bottles should be kept clean,
and if the brushes are washed in water, they must be
thoroughly dried before using, as water will blister smooth,
calendered surfaces. Never let your brush get dry when
using, but dip it occasionally, care being taken not to have
too much on the brush, and use immediately, if the alcohol
evaporates from the dye it makes a much eifferent colour.'</p>
</div>

<hr class="rnarrow">

<p>The foregoing price-lists, &amp;c., as may be expected,
are all printed. It is not always, however, that the dealer
in 'advantages' goes to the expense of print in connection
with the documents he issues; he sometimes uses
the cyclostyle or mimeograph, particularly in the case of
directions for use accompanying the various articles in
which he deals. When, in this way, he has no longer
the friendly aid of the compositor or the printer's reader,
his vagaries of grammar and construction are revealed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
all their primitive innocence. To commence one of his
sentences is like embarking upon an unknown sea, or
following a half-beaten track through a desert. Onward
the course runs, apparently for ever, and no man can tell
when the end is coming, or what it is likely to be. Pelion
is piled upon Ossa, and Parnassus is over all.</p>

<p>A few days ago two or three of these documents were
sent to be copied out in type, so as to be somewhat
legible for the printer; and, as an evidence of their
singularly explicit nature, it may be mentioned that the
typist was under the impression that they were all parts
of one document, and copied out the whole as one, without
break from beginning to end. Such a thing, of course,
was quite excusable under the circumstances, as the reader
may judge from the following example of how not to do
it. The entire manuscript consists of one sentence only,
so far as punctuation is concerned, and is supposed to
contain directions for the use of the prepared cards mentioned
upon pp. 223-227. It runs to this effect:—</p>

<div class="catalog">

<p>'Directions.—When you part the pack to shuffle press
down a trifle and the cards will part to an Ace (the Ace will
be on top of the lower part) put that part with the Ace on
top and part again to another Ace now shuffle in all but the
four top cards, part the cards again to the third Ace and
shuffle in all but the top four cards, then put three cards on
top of the last Ace (this puts up three Aces with three cards
between them and three on top and is for a four handed
game) if one more or less than four are playing shuffle in one
more or less cards, (always have as many cards between and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>on top of the Aces as there are players excluding yourself)
when the left hand man deals and offers the cards to you to
cut you can shuffle them up in the same way (but you must
put "one less" card on top of the three Aces to get the Aces
yourself)'</p>
</div>

<p>Presumably this is the end of the 'instructions,' as
there is no more matter to follow; but one cannot be
surprised that an unhappy typist, endeavouring to make
sense of it, should follow straight on to the next, under
the impression that the general effect of disjointedness
thus produced was part and parcel of the whole occult
scheme.</p>

<p>The directions sent out with the 'Jacob's Ladder'
vest machine are very similar in character to the last.
There is, however, one 'full-stop' in this case, probably
the one which the typist was looking for. This is the
manner in which the dealer instructs the purchaser in
the use of his machine:—</p>

<div class="catalog">

<p class="p0 p1 center">'DIRECTIONS FOR VEST MACHINE</p>

<p>'Fasten the Belt around your waist so that the Machine
will come on left side far enough from the edge of Vest to let
the cards go back out of sight. Pin the under lap of Vest on
the edge to the belt opposite the third or middle button, if
you are a large man or if you want the mouth of the M-
to come out farther, turn down the screw on front part of
Lever, to hold out 3 cards place them back of a few others
held in left hand with a break or opening between them on
the lower ends, press against the lever with the lower part of
arm and as the mouth of the M- comes out to the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>Vest put the cards in (let your little finger come against the
lower side of the mouth) this will be a guide and you can put
the cards in without looking down, (a good way is to reach
over to your checks or to "put up" with right hand while
working the Machine) less than a 1/2-in. pressure will throw
out the cards'</p>
</div>

<p>The instances above quoted will be sufficient to give
the reader a fair notion of the barefaced manner in
which these nefarious dealings are carried on. There is
no beating about the bush in any instance; no hiding
away of the real intent with which the goods are supplied.
They are not called cheating-tools in so many words, but
no attempt is made to smother up the actual nature of
the articles. The dealer does not say 'Special Cards,'
or 'Comical Cards,' or anything of the kind. He puts
the matter plainly before his customers, and says, 'Our
Latest Marked Back Playing Cards!' There is no mistaking
his meaning; he is proud of it, and likes to let
the world know the kind of things he has to sell.</p>

<p>'And where are the police all the while?' you ask.
Echo answers 'Where?' and that is the only reply which
is forthcoming. They must know of these places where
the implements of robbery are made and sold; yet, as a
rule, they appear to take no notice of what is going on.
Now and again, in those places where the regulations
are particularly strict, they have a spasmodic burst of
activity; and then the dealers lie low for awhile, until
all is quiet again. Occasionally it may happen that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
dealer, whose advertisements have become too flagrantly
palpable, is pounced upon and compelled to desist; but
even when such a person is obliged to close his business
altogether, he simply migrates to the next State, and supplies
his former customers through the medium of the
Post Office. Very little hardship is entailed upon him,
as those who deal with him are necessarily scattered far
and wide in various parts of the world, and the stock is
not very difficult to remove.</p>

<p>The 'Express Offices' in America must surely know
all about this kind of traffic, since they allow the
swindling machinery to be tried in their depôts. The
C.O.D. system is ample evidence of their connivance.</p>

<p>In sending marked cards through the post, a whole
pack is seldom despatched in one parcel. As a rule they
are sent a few at a time. This proceeding avoids the
payment of duty upon them, effecting a considerable
saving sometimes. Other articles are described as
sample parts of machinery, and duty is paid upon them
in accordance with their value.</p>

<p>The system upon which the business of these firms is
conducted shows that not only have they sound commercial
instincts, but also that they know their customers
particularly well, and have had experience of the
class of people with whom they have to deal. They are
prepared to send their goods on approval at any time,
but on condition that they receive a certain amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
cash with the order, or at any rate the equivalent of cash,
and a guarantee of payment of the balance on delivery.
The fact is, they take good care to let no article go out
of their hands until they have been paid a little more
than it is really worth; and, therefore, if the sharp who
purchases it should prove so forgetful of his obligations
as to neglect payment of the remainder, the dealer still
makes a profit. As one firm states upon the cover of its
price-list, <i>We will not deviate from the above terms</i>—and
they don't. Cash on delivery is what they require, or,
as it is usually abbreviated, 'C.O.D.' There is a good
deal of C.O.D. about these transactions, in more ways
than one.</p>

<p>In spite of their supposed 'cuteness' one often finds
that sharps are as apt to be inveigled into the purchase
of worthless articles by means of bogus advertisements
as any of their dupes. In certain of the American
papers the following advertisement was at one time
often seen:—</p>

<p>'Electric cards, as used by professional gamblers.
$1,00, &amp;c. Apply—.'</p>

<p>On sending his money to the dealer, the sharp would
receive a common pack of cards, with the same instructions
as those sent out with the varnished cards which
slip at the aces (p. 304). A separate slip was enclosed,
however, which informed him that these cards would
only retain their electricity for twenty-four hours. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
was, therefore, advised to buy a battery wherewith to
recharge (?) them; for the sum of $30.00. When he had
made this additional purchase, he found what a little
knowledge of electricity would have told him at first,
that he had been 'had on toast.' Honour among
thieves, again!</p>

<p>Among the dealers in 'advantages' there are some
humourists. One man who kept an 'emporium' for the
sale of these things in New York City, but who was
moved into an adjoining State by the police, used to
have his envelopes embellished by the semblance of a
bull dog, and the motto 'We still live.' Not bad, is it?</p>

<p>The price lists issued by this same individual were in
the form of pamphlets, and contained very exaggerated
descriptions of his apparatus and the results produced
thereby. Interspersed with the more prosaic details of his
wares, one found now and again wise saws or proverbs,
altered to suit the tastes of his patrons. Some of the
choicest of these 'modern instances' ran as follows:—</p>

<p>'A bug is far above rubies.'</p>

<p>'A holdout in the vest is more use than snide
jewelry in the pocket.'</p>

<p>'Get proper tools and use them with discretion, and
you will win and last.'</p>

<p>And so on. This kind of thing exhibits the lighter
and brighter side of the sharp's nature with much vividness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
The reader may have noticed, at the end of one of
the price-lists, that the dealer is able to give references
as to his trustworthiness to respectable firms 'who don't
recommend advantage goods.' This will not be a matter
for surprise when it is understood that the man is
supposed to be an honest tradesman carrying on a reputable
business. In all probability his referees would have
no idea as to the sort of person to whose <i>bona fides</i> they
are attesting. On the other hand, of course, they may
know all about it, in which case they are manifestly no
better than the man they are recommending. Still, even
in that event, the reference is quite good enough for the
sort of people who are likely to be buyers of swindling
apparatus. The author has a few dollars' worth of this
kind of thing; so perhaps the reader may be inclined to
observe that 'Dwellers in glass houses,' &amp;c. However,
that's another matter. This book would never have been
forthcoming if the author had any objection to a few
pounds finding their way into the pockets of those who
don't deserve them. The end must justify.</p>

<p>The fact that these people should be allowed to
carry on their trade in the way they do is nothing short
of a standing disgrace to America and a satire upon
civilisation. All men have an admiration for America,
though some may only half express it. Let her only
be true to herself, true to her traditions, and true to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
her <i>origin</i>; let her deal firmly with those who mar her
fair fame; let her learn to cherish that which is best
and brightest among her children, and she will one
day become the glory of the world—but that day is
not yet.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>SHARPS AND FLATS</i></span></h2>

<p>Now that we have reached the final stage of our inquiry,
the reader having been put in possession of all the facts
which are material and of importance in connection with
it, nothing more remains than to take a brief review of
our position, as it were, and see precisely how we stand—to
regard the question of gambling as a whole, in fact,
and see what conclusions we may arrive at with regard
to it, when it is viewed with the eye of common sense,
and in the light of the knowledge we have obtained.
Every subject, of course, has many aspects, and gambling
may be regarded from many different standpoints. In
this last chapter, then, and with the reader's permission,
I will take the liberty of regarding it from my own; and,
no objection being raised to the proposal, I should prefer
to regard these concluding remarks as being made confidentially,
so to speak, between the reader and myself.
If, in delivering myself of what remains to be said, I
should appear to speak either egotistically or dogmatically,
I crave pardon beforehand, and beg the reader to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that, if I am inclined to emphasise any particular point
bearing upon the matter in hand, it is because I feel
strongly with reference to it, and not because I wish to
pose in the eyes of the world as a champion of right and
an opponent of wrong.</p>

<p>Fear has been expressed, in some quarters, that the
publication of the secrets contained in this book will be
the means of increasing the number of sharps; that I am
simply providing a manual for the instruction of budding
swindlers. This may appear very cogent reasoning to
some; but, for all that, it is very poor logic, in reality.
In fact, a more groundless fear could not be entertained.
It would be as reasonable to say that the manufacture of
safes and strong-rooms, and the increase of safeguards
against thieves, will tend to augment the number of
burglars. Or, to come nearer to the point at issue, one
may as well assert that the exposure of spiritualistic
frauds has increased the number of 'mediums.' The
subject of spiritualism affords a most striking proof of
the absurdity of such a contention. Contrast the state
of affairs twenty-five years ago, before the crusade
against spiritualistic humbug, with that of the present
day. Then, dozens of impostors were doing a thriving
business. The medium was as much in demand as the
most popular society entertainer, and could command
larger fees. Spiritualism was a fashionable amusement;
the drawing-rooms of the aristocracy were constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
being darkened for séances. Now, only two or three
miserable rogues, without ability to earn a living in any
other way, are dragging out a wretched existence in the
East End of London, giving séances in back parlours,
and charging a fee of a shilling a head. Even in
America things are not much brighter for the medium.
Compare Dr. Slade's success in London with his sad end
in America, a few weeks ago. In fact, the business is
utterly ruined; those who have sufficient ability have
become conjurers and 'exposers of spiritualism'; others
have become gambling sharps and 'hypnotic subjects.'
These facts constitute a complete answer to the assertion
that this book will tend to increase the practice of sharping.
I maintain that no young man's education should
be considered complete without some knowledge of the
capabilities of trickery; for, without it, he may be imposed
upon by any charlatan.</p>

<p>Apart from the question of sharping, and with reference
to the fallacies indulged in by gamblers at large,
there are, among a multiplicity of others, three which
demand our special attention, and with which I particularly
wish to deal. These three mistaken, though very
commonly entertained notions, constitute the very basis
of what is called fair gambling. They are these:—</p>

<p>1. That gambling is essentially honest.</p>

<p>2. That a bet may be fair to both parties.</p>

<p>3. That betting on fair odds, the chances of each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>bettor will, in the long run, so equalise themselves that
neither can win nor lose, in an infinite number of bets.</p>

<p>Now, what I undertake to show may be summed up
in three statements, which can be put <i>per contra</i> to the
others, viz.:—</p>

<p>1. That gambling is essentially dishonest.</p>

<p>2. That a bet may be <i>unfair</i> to both parties, but
cannot possibly be fair to more than one, and that only
at the expense of gross injustice to the other.</p>

<p>3. That a protracted run of betting gives the gambler
no more chance of winning, or of recouping his losses,
than he has in making a single bet.</p>

<p>Here, then, I bring the whole gambling fraternity—sharps
and flats alike—about my ears. But, having
courage of my opinions, I stand to my guns, and am
prepared to hold my own against all comers. I will even
go so far as to back my opinion in 'the good old English
way' (why English?) to the extent of sixpence—beyond
which I never go. Stay, though, I am speaking hastily.
I did once back a horse for the Derby to the extent of a
guinea. When I say that the horse was 'Maskelyne, by
Magic—Mystery' (I believe that was the formula given
by the sporting papers), perhaps I may be forgiven the
extravagance for once. I have less compunction in
mentioning the circumstance because the horse was
'scratched.' 'Maskelyne' was a rank outsider, and I did
not even have 'a run for my money.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
But to return. I have said that gambling is essentially
dishonest. This is no new statement, I am aware; but
it is one upon which too much stress cannot be laid. A
bet is almost universally considered to be a fair bargain.
But is it? A <i>fair</i> bargain is one in which each person
receives something which is of more value to him than
that with which he has parted, or, at any rate, something
which is of equal value. If either receives less
value than he gives, that person has been swindled, and
the fact of winning a bet signifies that one has deprived
another of money for which no due consideration has
been given. The gambler, of course, will argue that he
<i>does</i> give an equivalent return for what he wins, in that
he allows his opponent an equal chance of depriving him
of a similar amount; that is to say, he purchases the
right to cheat another by giving his opponent an
equal chance of depriving him of a similar amount.
In short, a bet is simply a mutual agreement to
compound a felony. The fact that both parties to the
transaction are equally in the wrong cannot possibly
justify either. But it may be argued that no loser of
a bet ever considers that he has been unjustly deprived
of his money. That again is quite a mistaken notion.
No man ever lost a bet who did not consider that he
had every right to win it, otherwise he would never have
made it. Therefore he is just as much robbed as though
he had had his pocket picked. Because another will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
cheat me if he has the chance, that does not justify me
in cheating him if I can. If a man seeks to take my life,
I may be justified in killing him, as a last resource, in
order to protect myself; but, in a transaction involving
merely pounds, shillings and pence, there is no necessity
to fight a man with his own weapons. The act of cheating
is not the weapon with which to combat the desire to
cheat; yet this is what actually takes place even in so-called
fair gambling.</p>

<p>It must be obvious to any one who will take the
trouble to think over the matter, that chances which are
fair and equal are a question of proportion rather than
of actual amounts and odds. At first sight, however, it
would appear that if a man stands an equal chance of
winning or losing a certain amount, nothing fairer could
possibly be imagined, from whatever point of view one
may regard it. I venture to say, nevertheless, that this
is not so. Suppose for the moment that you are a poor
man, and that you meet a rich acquaintance who insists
upon your spending the day with him, and having what
the Americans call 'a large time.' At the end of the day
he says to you, 'I will toss you whether you or I pay this
day's expenses.' Such a proposition is by no means
uncommon, and suppose you win, what is the loss to him?
Comparatively nothing. He may never miss the amount
he has to pay; but if you lose, your day's outing may
have to be purchased by many weeks of inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
A bet of a hundred pounds is a mere bagatelle to a
rich man, but it may be everything to a poor one. In
the one case the loss entails no inconvenience, in the
other it means absolute ruin. It must be granted, then,
in matters of this kind, that proportion is the chief factor,
not the actual figures. If you are with me so far, you
are already a step nearer to my way of thinking.</p>

<p>Let us proceed a step further, and see how it is that a
bet is necessarily unfair to both parties. The simple
fact is that no two men can make a wager, however
seemingly fair, or however obviously unfair, without at
once reducing the actual value to them of their joint
possessions. This can be proved to a demonstration.
We will take a case in which the chances of winning are
exactly equal, both in amount and in proportion to the
wealth of two bettors. Suppose that your possessions
are precisely equal in amount to those of a friend, and
that your circumstances are similar in every respect.
There can be, then, no disparity arising from the fact of
a bet being made between you, where the chances of
winning or losing a certain amount are the same to each.
To present the problem in its simplest form, we will say
that you each stake one-half of your possessions upon
the turn of a coin. If it turns up head you win, if it falls
'tail up' your friend wins. Nothing could possibly be
fairer than this from a gambler's point of view. You
have each an equal chance of winning, you both stake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
an equal amount, you both stand to lose as much as you
can win, and, above all, the amount staked bears the
same value, proportionately, to the wealth of each
person. One cannot imagine a bet being made under
fairer conditions, yet how does it work out in actual fact?
You may smile when you read the words, but <i>you both
stand to lose more than you can possibly win</i>! You doubt
it! Well, we shall see if it cannot be made clear to
you.</p>

<p>Suppose the turn of the coin is against you, and therefore
you lose half your property; what is the result?
To-morrow you will say, 'What a fool I was to bet! I
was a hundred per cent. better off yesterday than I am
to-day.' That is precisely the state of the case; you
were exactly a hundred per cent. better off. Now, the
most feeble intellect will at once perceive that a hundred
per cent. can only be balanced by a hundred per
cent. If you stood a chance of being that much better
off yesterday than you are to-day, to make the chances
equal you should have had an equal probability of being
a hundred per cent. better off to-day than you were
yesterday. That is obvious upon the face of it, since
we agree that these questions are, beyond dispute, matters
of proportion, and not of actual amounts.</p>

<p>Then we will suppose you win the toss, and thus
acquire half your friend's property; what happens then?
When the morrow arrives you can only say, 'I am fifty per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
cent. better off to-day than I was yesterday.' That is
just it. If you lose, your losses have amounted to as
much as you still possess, whilst, if you win, your gains
amount only to one-third of what you possess. The plain
facts of the case, then, are simply that the moment you
and your friend have made the bet referred to, you have
considerably reduced the value of your joint possessions.
Not in actual amount, it is true, but in actual fact,
nevertheless; for whichever way the bet may go, the loss
sustained by one represents a future deprivation to that
one far greater than the future proportional advantage
gained by the other. The mere fact of one having gained
precisely as much as the other has lost does not affect the
ultimate result in the least. The inconvenience arising
from any loss is always greater than the convenience
resulting from an equal gain.</p>

<p>No man in his senses can be excused for making a
bet of this kind, even if one merely considers the injustice
inflicted upon himself; whilst in the case of a
man who has others dependent upon him, such a proceeding
could be nothing short of criminal. If by this
time you do not see that gambling, in any form, means a
possible loss of more than can be gained, all I can say is
that you should turn socialist, being totally unable to protect
or even recognise your individual interests. Civilisation
is wasted upon you. Properly speaking, if you
gamble fairly you are a flat; if you gamble unfairly you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
are a sharp: one or the other you must be. To be a
wise man, and an honest man, you cannot gamble at all.</p>

<p>Some of course will meet me half-way, and admitting
the truth of all I have put forward, will say, 'Yes, that
is all very well, but no gambler ever does stake half his
possessions upon a single bet; therefore the proportion
which any individual wager bears to his entire property
is infinitesimal.' That, again, is perfectly true; but I
cannot see nor have I ever met with any one who could
show me what difference can possibly exist between a
small number of bets for a large amount, and a large
number of bets for small amounts. Then comes in the
third fallacy I have mentioned. 'The chances,' some
will say, 'are bound to equalise themselves in the
long run, and then one can neither win nor lose.' Dear,
good, simple-minded souls! The <i>proportion</i> of gains to
losses, I grant, will become more equalised in an infinite
number of bets where the probabilities are always equal;
but the amount which may be lost, and the proportion it
bears to the belongings of the bettor, may ever <i>increase</i>
with the infinity of the bets.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, two men toss up a coin ten
times, and stake a pound upon the result of each toss.
We will say that one of them loses nine times, and wins
only once. He has lost four-fifths of the amount he has
staked in the aggregate; but what does it amount to?
Merely eight pounds. But suppose they go on tossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
for ten thousand times, and that the same player loses
only a hundredth part of the amount he has staked
during the whole time, he wins ninety-nine times for
every hundred losses. The proportion lost is infinitely
less than in the former case, yet the actual amount is one
hundred pounds. Let the throws be continued to a
million times, and suppose the player loses only a thousandth
part of what he has staked from beginning to end,
his losses will amount to exactly <i>one thousand pounds</i>.</p>

<p>To talk of an infinite number of bets equalising the
chances is sheer nonsense; it simply equalises the <i>ratio</i>
of the gains to the losses. The actual amounts won or
lost may increase indefinitely. At the same time the
player's original wealth does not vary; and the man who
has a thousand pounds may as well lose it in one throw
as in a million—better, in fact, as he will waste less time
over it.</p>

<p>I have tried to make this point somewhat clear,
because it is one upon which even the most scientific
gamblers—if one may use the term—are more or less
befogged. They all think that, if they only keep on long
enough, they are sure to win, or at any rate to recoup
their losses: but the life of any man is too short to be
certain of any such result, even in fair gambling—and
most gambling is not fair. The punter, of course, after
the manner of his kind, will differ from me in this last
statement. He is of opinion that the odds in ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
betting <i>are</i> fair. Well, if that is so, I should like to know
who keeps the bookmakers. I know <i>I</i> don't, and I
know the punter <i>does</i>. If he is satisfied, so are the
'bookies'; and certainly other people have no cause to
complain. The bookmaker, above all people, makes an
infinite number of bets, and therefore, theoretically, he
should neither win nor lose; but somehow he contrives
to 'live and move and have his being.' Those who
assist in maintaining him should best know how he
manages it, but they don't seem to realise it.</p>

<p>The absolute immorality of gambling—the desire to
obtain money to which one has no right—in any form is
beyond dispute; and the sooner this fact is generally
recognised, the better it will be for the world at large.
There are some, of course, in whom the passion is ingrained,
and from whose natures it can never be wholly
eradicated. But everyone should clearly understand
that the vice is as reprehensible in proportion to its
magnitude as that, for instance, of either lying or stealing.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter of this book I have said that
directly a man becomes a gambler he also becomes a
person whose honesty is open to suspicion. This may
appear to be a somewhat harsh and sweeping assertion,
but I maintain that it is absolutely justified by the facts
which come under my notice almost daily. As an
example of the laxity (to use no stronger term) which
gradually undermines the moral nature of the gambler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
however conscientious he may originally have been, I
may quote the following instance.</p>

<p>A few days ago a friend of mine, who belongs to a
West End Club, was discussing the subject of gambling
with a fellow member. In course of conversation he
put the query, 'If you detected a man in cheating at
the Club, what should you do?' To this the other
replied. 'I should back his play; and then, after the
game was over, I should make him give me half his
winnings.' This is what gambling had done for a presumably
honest 'Club man.'</p>

<p>With reference to the numberless systems of which
one hears now and then, which are supposed to provide
a certain means of enabling any gambler to win, despite
the chances and changes of fortune, it may be as well to
say a few words. These 'martingales,' as they are called,
are always intended for use, more especially in the great
gambling-houses of Monte Carlo and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of them, I should say, are as old as gambling itself;
others are of comparatively recent invention; but, one
and all, they are systems by means of which any amount
of money may be won, and any number of banks may be
broken—on paper. There is the trouble, they are useless
in practice. They really look so promising, however,
that it is very difficult to convince some people of their
futility. But the fact remains that these systems have
been in operation for generations, and never yet has a
gaming establishment been ruined by their aid. This
ounce of experimental proof is worth many pounds of
reasoning. Sometimes, of course, the martingale will
answer its purpose splendidly for a while; but, sooner
or later, the inevitable crash comes, when the system
breaks down, and the gambler is ruined. The great
defect of all these devices is that, although they may
promise a constant succession of comparatively small
gains, there is always the chance of making a very heavy
loss. This chance, of course, appears to the gambler to
be so remote as to be unworthy of consideration; but,
alas! that apparently remote chance is the rock upon
which generations of punters have split. It always turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
up eventually, and then the bank recovers all it has lost,
and in all probability a great deal more.</p>

<p>The simplest form of martingale, and one which is
typical of them all, however much more complicated or
'improved' they may be, is the one which consists of the
practice of doubling the stake after every loss. For
instance, at rouge-et-noir the gambler may stake a sovereign
and lose it. The next time he stakes two sovereigns,
and, if he loses, his third stake will be four
sovereigns. By pursuing this system it is obvious that,
whenever he does win, he will gain a sovereign over and
above his losses. Having won he will begin again with
a sovereign and double his bets each time, until he wins
as before. It would seem, then, that there must be a
constant influx of sovereigns to the gambler; and so
there may be for a time, but it will not last. In fact, he
may be ruined at the very first sitting. This is how it
happens. The success of the system depends upon the
assumption that the chances must, sooner or later, turn
in favour of the player; they cannot be against him for
ever, so he must win in the end. That is what he thinks.
But what he loses sight of is the fact that long spells of ill-luck
are particularly common. It is quite an ordinary thing
for a player to lose twenty times in succession; and meanwhile
the amount of the stakes has been increasing after
the manner of the familiar problem in arithmetic, wherein
the nails in a horse's shoes play so prominent a part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
The fact is, if the player has lost eleven times, his twelfth
stake will amount to £2,048. Obviously, then, a very
short run of bad fortune will either cause the player to
lose all his available money, or bring the stake up to the
amount beyond which the bank will not allow any single
bet to be made. What becomes of the martingale then?
Ask of the winds.</p>

<p>And thus it is with all these systems. Their inventors
fully believe in them, until they learn from bitter
experience that they have overlooked the one weak point,
the fallacy underlying the whole operation. Wherever
there is a chance of making a number of small gains,
there is always a chance of sustaining one great loss,
which will swallow up many hundred times the value of
any single stake. From this unfortunate circumstance
there is no escape, no matter how ingenious the system
may be, and notwithstanding any amount of infallibility
it may appear to possess. A mathematician would
demonstrate the folly of relying upon any martingale,
and lay his finger upon the weak points in a few minutes.
In short, these things one and all provide a means of
winning which is just about as reliable as the advice
given by the 'Old Pard' in 'My Sweetheart,' whose dying
words were, 'Always copper the Queen on the last
turn.' This, of course, was intended to refer to the
game of faro. One may suppose that when the Queen
remained in the dealing-box until the last turn, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
experience had been that it always turned up for the
bank, and hence his advice to 'copper.' Another
person's experience might have been just the opposite,
and in that case the advice would be quite the contrary.
Everything of this kind hinges upon superstition, and a
belief in good and bad luck. When a 'lucky' gambler
wins, his acquaintances express no surprise; they consider
his good-fortune to be part and parcel of his nature.
When he begins to lose, they suffer not a whit more
astonishment, because such luck as his could not possibly
last. The theories in each case are utterly at variance
with one another, but the absurdity of the position never
seems to reveal itself to the gambling intellect. The
ultimate fate of the confirmed gambler, however fortunate
he may be for a time, has always been, without exception,
ruin and destitution. That is the only result ever
achieved by the punter in the end.</p>

<p>So much, then, for 'fair gambling.' As to the blacker
side of the question, as revealed in this book, what can
be said of it, or what need be said of it? The reader
may draw his own conclusions, which will doubtless vary
according to the fact of his being either a sharp or a flat.
The sharps will, unquestionably, be among those who
are most anxious to see what disclosures are made
herein; let us hope they will be satisfied with the
thoroughness of the revelations. It would be a pity to
disappoint them. On the other hand, the flats will find
much food for thought in these pages. They must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
run away with the impression that by mastering the
details thus put before them they will render themselves
proof against sharping. If they imagine anything of the
kind they will become simply 'fly flats,' and that will not
improve their chances very much if they fall into the
hands of an expert. Apart from the impossibility of
giving every device employed by all the sharps in existence,
it must be remembered that fresh trickeries are
continually being invented, though it may be many years
before new means of cheating can be devised which will
prove so effective as those enjoyed by the sharp at the
present day. He is generally equal to the occasion,
however, and has his own individual methods of working;
very often methods of which even his brother-sharps
are ignorant, and which die with him. We
can only hope that this book will be the means of
opening the eyes of his dupes, and of rendering the
chances of success in cheating less than they have been
hitherto.</p>

<p>But we cannot hope that the sharp will find <i>no</i>
dupes in the future; that is altogether too much to
expect. As long as the world is principally composed of
rogues and fools, so long will there be 'sharps and flats.'
'Surely the pleasure is as great in being cheated as to
cheat,' but the profit does not apportion itself in the
same manner. The sharp continually profits by his
experience, but the flat—never.</p>

<p>At any rate, I have done the best I can to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
forward a clear account of the methods of swindling at
games of chance and skill which are adopted at the
present day. At the same time I have tried to indicate
the best means of avoiding being cheated. It only
remains for the reader to make the best use of the
information given. I have no fear that, in writing what
I have, I shall be accused by sensible people of assisting
those sharps who may not know all that is here published.
The resources of these men are always equal to their
necessities; they can only cheat, at the worst, and the
sharp will always find means of cheating so long as he can
find dupes. Besides, this book will tend to make his
dupes as wise as himself, and should have the effect of
rendering them scarce.</p>

<p>Having published such information as I have been
able to acquire, I have no intention of relaxing my
vigilance in keeping a look-out for fresh developments
and new devices. Having put my hand to the plough
I shall not turn back; and, after me, I have every
reason to believe that my son will continue the work. He
has taken the liveliest interest in the production of this
book; and, indeed, the whole of the illustrations are by
him, with the exception of the frontispiece, which is by
my esteemed and talented friend, Alfred Bryan.</p>

<p>Here, then, I will leave the work for the present,
trusting that I have, in some measure, succeeded in

<h2><a name="POSTSCRIPT" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT</a></h2>

<p>Whilst this book is still in the press, an article on
'Science and Monte Carlo,' by Professor Karl Pearson,
has appeared in the (monthly) 'Fortnightly Review.'
This article deals with the game of roulette, and is one
which may be commended to the perusal of all who may
have any pet theories in connection with chance and
luck. It constitutes, in fact, a very serious impeachment
of the validity of all accepted theories of chance; so
serious, indeed, that one stands amazed at the discrepancies
which are revealed, and their having remained
so long unnoticed. There appears to be no way out of
the difficulty. Either roulette is not a game of chance,
or the doctrines of chance are utterly wrong.</p>

<p>It appears from Professor Pearson's investigations,
that in a given number of throws the results shown by
the "even-money" chances are fairly in accord with the
theory as a whole. That is to say, the odd and even
numbers, the red and black, turn up respectively in very
nearly equal proportions. Also the 'runs' or sequences
of odd or even are such as would not give rise to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
conflict between theory and practice. But the astounding
fact is that the 'runs' or successions of red or black
occur in a manner which is utterly at variance with
theory. Why this should be so, and why 'red and
black' should thus prove to be an exception to the
theory, whilst 'odd and even' is not, passes the wit of
man to comprehend.</p>

<p>In one of the cases quoted by Professor Pearson,
8,178 throws of the roulette-ball are compared with a
similar number of tosses of a coin, and both results are
checked against the theoretical probabilities. In tossing
a coin or throwing a roulette-ball 8,178 times, theory
demands that the number of throws which do not result
in sequences—that is to say, throws in which head is
followed by tail, or red by black-should be 2,044.
Those are the probabilities of the case. But the actual
results were as follows:—</p>

<table summary="roulette" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Theory</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">2,044</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Roulette</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">2,462</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Tossing</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">2,168</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>There are too many single throws in each case,
but the results given by tossing were much nearer the
theoretical proportion than in the case of the roulette.
Proceeding a step further, we find that the sequences
of two work out thus:—</p>

<table summary="roulette" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Theory</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">1,022</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Roulette</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">945</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Tossing</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">1,056</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Here the figures given by roulette are far too small.
This is found to be the case with sequences of three and
four also. When we come to sequences of five, however,
the numbers stand:—</p>

<table summary="roulette" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Theory</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">128</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Roulette</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">135</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Tossing</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">120</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In this case, the roulette is nearer the mark than the
tossing; and from this point onward through the higher
sequences, roulette gives numbers which are far too high.
For instance, in sequences of eight, theory says that
there should be 16, but roulette gives 30. In sequences
of eleven theory says 2, but roulette gives 5. Arriving at
sequences of twelve, the figures are:—</p>

<table summary="roulette" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Theory</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">1</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Roulette</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">1</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tdl cat1">Tossing</td>
        <td class="tdr cat">1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Here all the results are in accord.</p>

<p>This is only one instance out of several recorded by
Professor Pearson; in every case the results being similar.
That only one instance of such abnormal variation
should occur is, theoretically, well nigh impossible; but
that there should be three or four such cases in the course
of a single twelvemonth is nothing short of miraculous.
The chances against the occurrence of such events are
enormous; and yet every case investigated shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
same kind of result. Truly this must be another example
of the malignity of matter.</p>

<p>The practical outcome of these investigations is to
emphasise the utter futility of any scheme of winning at
roulette based upon the law of averages or the doctrines
of chance. It is more than likely, in my opinion, that
further analysis of the records of Monte Carlo would
reveal similar discrepancies in other departments of the
game.</p>

<p>Personally, I fail to see how the devotees of the
'Higher Statistics' will contrive to meet the difficulty
here presented. Why roulette should obey the laws of
chance in some respects and not in others, is incomprehensible
from any point of view whatever. One is
driven to the conclusion that human experience and
human statistics are upon too limited a scale to form a
sufficient basis upon which to found either the proof or
disproof of any universal theory. The only refuge
appears to be that, given eternity, all events, however
improbable, are possible.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that Professor Pearson will find an
opportunity of continuing his researches in this direction,
for the subject promises to be one of exceeding interest.
Of course, it may be objected that the few instances
given are insufficient to affect the theory materially; but,
as the Professor says of one of his instances, had roulette
been played constantly on this earth, from the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
geological times to the present day, such an event might
be expected to happen only once. Those who believe
that an infinite number of bets, where the chances are
fair and equal, can result in neither loss nor gain, should
ponder this carefully. If the doctrines of chance can
fail in one case, they can fail in others. At best, they
are but a broken reed, and those who trust to them
should beware the risk that is thereby entailed. Above
all, the punter should bear in mind that, whatever theory
may say or practice apparently demonstrate, the fact that
any given event has happened so many times in succession
makes not the slightest particle of difference to its
chances of happening again. If one tossed a coin a
hundred times, and it turned up 'head' every time, that
would not in any way lessen its chance of turning up the
same way at the next throw. The figures given in the
article above referred to are neither more nor less than
an illustration of this very palpable truth, extraordinary
as they undoubtedly are when viewed in the light of
theory.</p>

evening, a man standing by a roulette-table, who persistently put
down a five-franc piece upon the winning number, after it had been
declared. Of course, the 'croupier' never failed to detect the
manœuvre, and removed the stake. The fact which passed unnoticed,
however, was that a gold coin, value twenty francs, lay
hidden beneath the silver one as it was put down. Being commanded
to take up the five-franc piece, the man did so without
hesitation; but the gold piece remained on the table among the
other stakes. When the winnings were paid by the bank, that
particular coin was claimed by a confederate as being his stake,
and was paid accordingly. In roulette, the winning number
receives 35 times the amount staked; therefore the conspirators
netted 700 francs each time they succeeded in this little operation.
I should think the bank would not be long in discovering a robbery
of this kind, if it were very frequently perpetrated.</p></div>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
