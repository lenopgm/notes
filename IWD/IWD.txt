Advantages:
    multiclass means you can be a gnome for shorty bonuses and extra spells (you lose necromancy though) or you can be an elf for charm resistance and higher DEX.
    Thief abilities covered for the party so it provides good utility and you're always gaining levels so you'll get UAI and spike/time traps.
    Backstab, always beneficial to have in the party. Mage abilities pair up well with backstabbing: invisibility, mislead, Tenser's for Thac0, BBOD, etc.
    Access to stoneskin, pfmw, etc. always beneficial to have
	For those who see having a thief in the party as a necessary annoyance it's a great class that adds utility without sacrificing much. You'll have a caster who can use bows (always nice) and who can handle your locks/traps/scouting/pickpocketing.
	For those who like to actively use thieves in combat it's a nice class since mage abilities pair well with, and can enhance, backstabbing. Plus constantly gaining thief levels gives you access to HLA traps which are ridiculously OP.
	Basically it's a super versatile caster who can fulfill pretty much any role you want thanks to arcane spells and UAI.
    If you use Mislead as a T/M all your attacks will hit as backstabs, since Mislead lets you stay invis until the clone is destroyed.
    You can use Mage clones to place thief traps without using up your "real" traps. You can also send them to places ordinary thieves can't go without triggering events, such as The Ravager.
    Shapeshifting+Time Stop is an extremely powerful combo for Mages alone, but was a bit weak due to having recast time stop unless you could kill them in one. Now imagine that with Thief Traps that allows for 70 second time stop at the start of the fight without having to re-cast.
    Tenser's Transformation was always powerful in the hands of a mage, but never too powerful since they lacked APRs. Thieves, though, can stack 8-9 APRs dualwielding +1 APR weapons.
	Also, if you're wondering why Thief/Mage multi over Thief/Mage dual, the answer is simply Thief Traps HLAs. They are the strongest endgame tool in the game outside of mage 9th level spells, and Thief/Mage multi is the only class that have access to both. Basically Time Traps lets you open with 70 second time stop everywhere you can place traps, and Spike Traps one-shots every boss in the game, except the Ravager, which it leaves at Nearly Dead. Every other boss dies, including Abazigal, Balthazar, Amelyssan and Demogorgon.

Starting spells	
	My sorc picks are obviously spook and magic missile. Shield is my next pick since it stacks with higher-AC bracers and immunity to magic missile is sometimes helpful. My next pick is identify, mostly because it's super convenient to have on a sorc and because level 1 spell choices aren't that tight. Lastly, it's a tie between Sleep, Friends (for shop discounts if you have high CHA), and Protection from Evil. Prot evil is generally better handled by clerics, so my choice is Sleep since it's super strong in this game.
	Level 1: Sleep, Spook
	Level 3: Identify
	Level 5: Magic Missile
	Level 7: Shield
